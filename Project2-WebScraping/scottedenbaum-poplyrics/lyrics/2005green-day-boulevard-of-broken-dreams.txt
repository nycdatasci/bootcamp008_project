I walk a lonely road|The only one that I have ever known|Don't know where it goes|But it's home to me and I walk alone||I walk this empty street|On the Boulevard of broken dreams|Where the city sleeps|And I'm the only one and I walk alone||I walk alone|I walk alone||I walk alone|I walk a.....||My shadow's only one that walks beside me|My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating|Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me|Till then I walk alone||Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah|Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah||I'm walking down the line|That divides me somewhere in my mind|On the border line of the edge|And where I walk alone||Read between the lines|What's fucked up and everything's all right|Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive|And I walk alone||I walk alone|I walk alone||I walk alone|I walk a...||My shadow's only one that walks beside me|My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating|Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me|Till then I walk alone||Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah|Ah-ah, ah-ah||I walk alone|I walk a||I walk this empty street|On the Boulevard of broken dreams|Where the city sleeps|And I'm the only one and I walk a||My shadow's only one that walks beside me|My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating|Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me|Till then I walk alone

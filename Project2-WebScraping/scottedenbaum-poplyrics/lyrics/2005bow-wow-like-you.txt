[Chorus: Ciara]|I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you can show me|And the special way I feel when you hold me|We gone always be together baby that's what you told me|And I believe it|Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you||Now I done been with different kind of girls|Like I done seen em all but ain't none of them at all (like you)|And I done seen the best of the best|Baby still I ain't impressed cause ain't none of them at all (like you)|If you know how I feel when I chill|If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (like you)|And baby that's the way I feel|And I got no choice but for me to keep it real|Cause when we first got together started hanging out you was|Skeptical at first had to figure out if|I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out but|I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out|You found out when you turned to my baby|I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady|I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes|And I ain't tripping or acting shady cause baby you know||[Chorus]||And every time I think about you (I smile)|When you ride when you call when you come I (ride)|Your love is amazing to me|Can't wait til I see you (I wanna be wit you again)|And every time you're out on the road (I make a trip)|And whenever I'm doing a show (Don't you forget)|That I'm your (main chick)|Who got that (game chick)|One and the (same chick)|The one you can hang with||[Chorus]||Okay when you hit the mall pop tags spend a few g's|Hit the runway to a new season (season)|It ain't nothing it's you the one I care for|Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I share more (share more)|I give you this give you that what you need love (love)|You know I got it holla at me if you need love (love)|And affection cause I'll be your protection|Kinda hard job but I'll do it to perfection|And you can tell that I ain't trying let you go|I get with you when I can so that's how I let you know|And you be tripping cause sometimes I gotta go|But you the first one I holler to right after my shows|And I was tripping in a sense I was tense|From my body loose around you what I'ma do without you|I gotta get it together say whatever|Cause since I met you my life seems so better||[Chorus: x2]

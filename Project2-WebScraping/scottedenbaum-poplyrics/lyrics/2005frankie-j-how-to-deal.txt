Sometimes a man has to choose|And do something he doesn't want to do|Do I live my life with you as my wife|Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream|I gotta do this for me|'Cause if I don't I'll probably regret it|But if I do I'll probably regret it|How do I cope||How do you cope when|The one you love is with somebody else|And there's nothing you could do about it|How do I deal with|The fact that you had a chance|But you chose to turn away for your career|I gotta take it though it's heartbreakin'|It's something that I had to do|But nobody said that it would hurt so bad|So how do I live, how do I deal without you||It's killing me to know|That your heart hurts with me|But you're with him cause I chose|To be in this industry|Money, shows, and hoes come along with luxury and pain|Is all you see when you think about it|But this is the life that I was given|So I have to live it to the fullest|But how do I deal in the meantime without you||How do you cope when|The one you love is with somebody else|And there's nothing you could do about it|How do I deal with|The fact that you had a chance|But you chose to turn away for your career|I gotta take it though it's heartbreakin'|It's something that I had to do|But nobody said that it would hurt so bad|So how do I live, how do I deal without you

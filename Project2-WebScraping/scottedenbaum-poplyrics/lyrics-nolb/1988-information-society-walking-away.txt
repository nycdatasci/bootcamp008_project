Cold winds blow around me,And I can't help but think of you.All the things we wanted,All the things we had to do.Wrap yourself around me,We can steal away sometime.Your whispers surround me,But it's only in my mind.'cause I'm walking away from,Walking away from things in my own past.Walking away from,Walking away from things that just won't last.You got what you wanted,But you can't help but think of me.All the things you wanted,All the things you got for free.One thing to rememberIs that I have feelings, too.I surely would have closed my eyesIf I had known the real you.'cause I'm walking away from,Walking away from things in my own past.Walking away from,Walking away from things that just won't last.And I'm walking away from,Walking away from things that move too fast.

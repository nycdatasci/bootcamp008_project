Roll into town step off the bus,Shake off the where you came from dust,Grab you guitar walk down the street,Sign says Nashville Tennessee,But I have found,It's a crazy town full of neon dreams,Everybody plays everybody sings,Hollywood with a touch of twang,To be a star you gotta bang bang bang,Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,In this crazy town,Pay your dues and you play for free,And you pray for a honky tonk destiny,You cut your teeth in the smokey bars,And live off the tips from a pickle jarTill find a cool new soundAnd you smile when the record man shoots you down,It's a crazy town full of neon dreams,Everybody plays everybody sings,Hollywood with a touch of twang,To be a star you gotta bang bang bang,Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,In this crazy town,One year they reposes your truck,And the next you make a couple million bucks,It's a crazy town full of neon dreams,Everybody plays everybody sings,Hollywood with a touch of twang,To be a star you gotta,Bend those strings till the Hank comes out,Make all the drunk girls scream and shout,We love it we hate it we're all just trying to make it,We love it we hate it we all came here to make it,In this crazy town,It's a crazy town.

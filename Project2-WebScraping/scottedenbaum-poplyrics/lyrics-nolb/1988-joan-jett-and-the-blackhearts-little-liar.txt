I was taught to never tell a lieTo look you in the eye and tell it like it is.Always thought that you would be the sameIt's such a shame that's not the way it is.I was fooled by your innocence.And my love for you was so intense.With our connection only physical,If it got me through the nightWell, that's a lie.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you, oh!A simple question makes you look away.Your hesitation gives it all away.There's some protection in the way you move.If there's sadness in my eyes,It's coming from your lies.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.I believed in you.You want to sleep with me, but payback's tough.Why don't you call me when you're all grown up?If there's a change in you, I'll know it's true.Hey little liar, I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar. I believed in you.Hey little liar.Hey little liar.Hey little liar.

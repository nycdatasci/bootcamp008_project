This romeo is bleedingBut you can't see his bloodIt's nothing but some feelingsThat this old dog kicked upIt's been raining since you left meNow I'm drowning in the floodYou see I've always been a fighterBut without you I give upNow I can't sing a love songLike the way it's meant to beWell, I guess I'm not that good anymoreBut baby, that's just meAnd I will love you, baby alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day alwaysI'll be there till the stars don't shineTill the heavens burst andThe words don't rhymeAnd I know when I die, you'll be on my mindAnd I'll love you - AlwaysNow your pictures that you left behindAre just memories of a different lifeSome that made us laugh, some that made us cryOne that made you have to say goodbyeWhat I'd give to run my fingers through your hairTo touch your lips, to hold you nearWhen you say your prayers try to understandI've made mistakes, I'm just a manWhen he holds you close, when he pulls you nearWhen he says the words you've been needing to hearI'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mineTo say to you till the end of timeYeah, I will love you baby alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day alwaysIf you told me to cry for youI couldIf you told me to die for youI wouldTake a look at my faceThere's no price I won't payTo say these words to youWell, there ain't no luckIn these loaded diceBut baby if you give me just one more tryWe can pack up our old dreamsAnd our old livesWe'll find a place where the sun still shinesAnd I will love you, baby alwaysAnd I'll be there forever and a day alwaysI'll be there till the stars don't shineTill the heavens burst andThe words don't rhymeAnd I know when I die, you'll be on my mindAnd I'll love you always

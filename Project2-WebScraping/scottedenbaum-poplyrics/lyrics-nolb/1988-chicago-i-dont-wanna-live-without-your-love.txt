Thought it wouldn't matterIf we didn't stay together,And if it was over,Maybe it was for the better.I was thinking I'd be alright,'til I thought it all through.Now I know that I ain't really livingIf I have to live without you.I don't want to live without your love,I don't want to face the night alone.I could never make it through my lifeIf I had to make it on my own.I don't want to love nobody else,I don't want to find somebody new.I don't want to live without your love,I just want to live my life with you.Guess I had to go away,So much I had to go through.Guess I had to lose youTo realize how much I love you.Can we make the fire burn again,Burn a little stronger?'cause I've been alone, and baby,I can't be alone now any longer.I don't want to live without your love,I don't want to face the night alone.I could never make it through my lifeIf I had to make it on my own.I don't want to love nobody else,I don't want to find somebody new.I don't want to live without your love,I just want to live my life with you.Oh, if I had to make it on my own,My life would never be the same,My love would never be the same.I don't want to live without your love.[chorus repeats]

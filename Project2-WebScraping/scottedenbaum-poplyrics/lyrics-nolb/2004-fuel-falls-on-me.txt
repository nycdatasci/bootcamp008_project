I've seen you hanging roundThis darkness where I'm boundAnd this black hole I've dug for meAnd silently withinWith hands touching skinThe shock breaks my diseaseAnd I can breatheAnd all of your weightAll you dreamFalls on me it falls on meAnd your beautiful skyThe light you bringFalls on me, it falls on meYour faith like the painDraws me in againShe washes all my wounds for meThe darkness in my veinsI never could explainAnd I wonder if you ever seeWill you still believe?And all of your weightAll you dreamFalls on me it falls on meAnd your beautiful skyThe light you bringFalls on me, it falls on meAm I that strongTo carry on?I might change your lifeI might save my worldCould you save me?And all of your weightAll you dreamFalls on me it falls on meAnd your beautiful skyThe light you bringFalls on me, it falls on meAnd all of your weightAll you dreamFalls on me it falls on meAnd your beautiful skyAnd the light you bringFalls on me, it falls on me

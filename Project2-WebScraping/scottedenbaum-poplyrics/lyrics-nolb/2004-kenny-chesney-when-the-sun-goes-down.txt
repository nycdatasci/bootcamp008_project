Sun tan toes, ticklin' the sand,Cold drink chillin' in my right hand,Watchin' you sleep in the evening light,Restin' up for a long long night.'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.All day long, just taking it easy,Laying in a hammock, where it's nice and breezy,Been sleepin' off the night before, 'cause when the sun goes down,We'll be back for more.'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.This old guitar,and my dark sunglasses,This sweet concoction is as smooth as molasses,Nothing to do, but breath all day,Until the big moon rises and its time to play.'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.'Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down.When the sun goes down, we'll be groovin',When the sun goes down, we'll be feelin' alright,When the sun sinks down, over the water,She thinks crackers sexy when the sun goes down.

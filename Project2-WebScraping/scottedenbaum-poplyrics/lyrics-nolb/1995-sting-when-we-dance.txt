If he loved you like I love you, I would walk away in shame.I'd move town, I'd change my name.When he watches you, when he counts to buy your soul,On your hand his golden rings like he owns a bird that sings.When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.The priest has said my soul's salvation is in the balance of the angelsAnd underneath the wheels of passion.I keep the faith in my fashion.When we dance angels will run and hide their wings.(I will love you more than life if you'll only be my wife.)(I'm gonna love you night and day. I'm gonna try in every way.)When we dance angels will run and hide their wings.(I'm gonna find a place to live, give you all I've got to give.)(I will love you more than life if you'll only be my wife.)If I could break down these walls and shout my name at heaven's gate,I'd take these hands and I'd destroy the dark machineries of fate.Cathedrals are broken, heaven's no longer above,And hell fire's a promise away I'd still be saying I'm still in love.Still in love, still in love, still in love, still in loveHe won't love you, like I love you.He won't care for you this way.He'll mistreat you if you stay.Come and live with me.We'll have children of our own.I would love you more than life if you'll come and be my wife.When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.When we dance, angels will run and hide their wings.When we dance.(I'm gonna love you night and day. I'm gonna try in every way.)(I'm gonna find a place to live, give you all I've got to give.)(I will love you more than life if you'll only be my wife.)(I'm gonna love you night and day. I'm gonna try in every way.)

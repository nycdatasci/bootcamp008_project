Paper Doll ( Paper Doll ), Paper Doll ( Paper Doll )Hello, Imagine yourself and a link on a chain, the chain is wrapped around someones mind,If you break off then things start to change. Then You realize that there's no time,No direction as you fly through the wind. you stop to ponder on a pink chateau.The theme from "Mohogany" still transcends. But Quote Unqoute, that's the way it goes.I'm looking at the picture again. I'm looking at the picture again.I spin the sundial to expectation, twenty years ago I saw you yesterday.You're looking at the picture. I see you looking at the picture nowAnd for the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll.[Chorus]One of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll), paper dollOne of these days I think you will find yourself as a paper doll, (paper doll), oh, paper doll.Imagine yourself as a cloud in the sky. You pass me by and I blow you a kiss.A thinking cloud, so you're wondering why, only to find out it doesn't exist.Life surrounds what's presumed as wise. It wouldn't be wise until the fist uncurls.No one I don't know ever stands in my eyes. Because of the quote unquote, real world.I'm thinking about yesterday. I'm actually thinking about yesterday.A thousand words say it doesn't exist. A thousand ideas tell me otherwise.You're thinking about yesterday. I know you're thinking about yesterday butFor the slightest moment I watched you think about what it's like as a paper doll.[Chorus]Regardless of how you think, regardless of how you feel, see yourself as,More than a human being. It's recognizable, spiritually and mentally.Hold my hands forever, paper doll.[Chorus]

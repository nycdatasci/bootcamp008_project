I see nothing in your eyes,And the more I see the less I like.Is it over yet, in my head?I know nothing of your kind,And I won't reveal your evil mind.Is it over yet? I can't win.So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.I'm going all the way, get away, please.[Chorus]You take the breath right out of me.You left a hole where my heart should be.You got to fight just to make it through,'Cause I will be the death of you.This will be all over soon.Pour salt into the open wound.Is it over yet?Let me in.So sacrifice yourself, and let me have what's left.I know that I can find the fire in your eyes.I'm going all the way, get away, please.[Chorus]I'm waiting, I'm praying, realize, start hating.[Chorus]

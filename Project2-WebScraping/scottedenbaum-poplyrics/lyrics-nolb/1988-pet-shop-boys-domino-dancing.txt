I don't know why, I don't know how,I thought I loved you but, I'm not sure now,I've seen you look at strangers,Too many times,The love you want, is of a different kindAll day, all day, Watch them all fall down,All day, all day, Domino dancing,Remember when we felt the sun,A love like paradise,How hot it burned,A threat of distant thunder,The sky was red,And where you walked you always,Turned ev'ry headAll day, all day, Watch them all fall down,All day, all day, Domino dancing,I thought that when we foughtI was to blame,But now I know you play,A different game,I've seen you dance with danger,Still wanting more,Add another number, To the scoreAll day, all day, Watch them all fall down,All day, all day, Domino dancing,When you look around you wonderDo you play to win or are you just a bad loser?All day, all day, All day, all day,I don't know why, I don't know how,I thought I loved you but, I'm not sure now,I hear the thunder crashing, The sky is dark,And now a storm is breaking, Within my heart.All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,All day, all day, Domino dancing,All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,All day, all day, Domino dancing,All day, all day, Watch them all fall down,

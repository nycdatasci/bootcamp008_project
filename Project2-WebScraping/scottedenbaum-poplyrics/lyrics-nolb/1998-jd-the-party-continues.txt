When I'm done with thinking then I'm done with you.When I'm done with crying then I'm done with you.When I feel so tired then I'm done with you.Everybody feels this way sometimes everybody feels this wayAnd I do.You can't hear it but I do.You can't hear it but I do.You're trying to convince me that what I've done's not right.I get so frustrated I stay up every night.You ask me for an answer and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air.Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this wayAnd I do.You can't hear it, but I do.You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you sayI will be ignored.I will be denied.I could be erased.I could be brushed asideI will get scared, and I will get shoved down,But I feel like I do because you push me around.I'm starting to ignore you, I've doubted you so long.I'm tired of overthinking, I know you don't belong.Now I'm asking questions - no one pushes me around.Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way -And I do.You can't hear it, but I do.You don't seem angry, but I do.I do.

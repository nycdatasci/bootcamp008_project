All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...Hey...Spend your money on the corner now,Know you've gotta save some for the shoeshine boyYou've been pulling them by the hand inside,Oh...collecting all your toys.If you need a lead to heaven now, just stick aroundYou're going to be there.What do you care?What do you dare?What does your heart say now?All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...Divine intervention, couldn't keep the word from leaking out,With your pleasure in suspensionNot to mention what you hang it aroundIf you need a lead to heaven,A place to shareIn every position..What do you care?What do you dare?What does your heart say now?All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...More!All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...All she wants is...

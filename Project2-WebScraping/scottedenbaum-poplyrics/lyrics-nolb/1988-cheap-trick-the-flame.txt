Another night slowly closes inAnd I feel so lonelyTouching heat freezing on my skinI pretend you still hold meI'm going crazy, I'm losing sleepI'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over youI can't believe you're goneYou were the first, you'll be the lastWherever you go, I'll be with youWhatever you want, I'll give it to youWhenever you need someoneTo lay your heart and head uponRemember, after the fire, after all the rainI will be the flameI will be the flameWatching shadows move across the wallI feel so frightenedI wanna run to you, I wanna callBut I've been hit by lightningJust can't stand up for fallin' apartCan't see through this veil across my heart, over youYou'll always be the oneYou were the first, you'll be the lastWherever you go, I'll be with youWhatever you want, I'll give it to youWhenever you need someoneTo lay your heart and head uponRemember, after the fire, after all the rainI will be the flameI will be the flameI'm going crazy, I'm losing sleepI'm in too far, I'm in way too deep over youYou'll always be the oneYou were the first, you'll be the lastWherever you go, I'll be with youWhatever you want, I'll give it to youWhenever you need someoneTo lay your heart and head uponRemember, after the fire, after all the rainI will be the flameI will be the flameWhatever you want, I'll give it to youWherever you go, I'll be with youAnd whatever you want, I'll give it to you

When I was young and the world belonged to me,I thought that love meant pain and jealousy.It was a cross on my shoulder.Oh, Lord, now I feel so much older.Mmm. Mmm.Time had a way of making me see my lonely life has taken its toll on me.Now, I feel the emptiness and I don't wanna live like this.Now, I've heard stories, I've heard songs telling me believe my heart.Don't wait too long with words that don't ring true until there was you.Never will I lose this heart's desire.Ever will I feel our love's fire only when I knowThat you'll be mine until the end of time.How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel,And how deep my soul, how much can I reveal?I'm lost in love's mystery, caught between time and eternity.Now, there's a door that opens wide.Slowly I will find my way and I'll reach inside.But I couldn't make it through until there was you.

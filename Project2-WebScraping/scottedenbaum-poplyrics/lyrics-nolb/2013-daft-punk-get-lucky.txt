[Pharrell Williams Vocals]Like the legend of the Phoenix,All ends with beginnings.What keeps the planets spinning,The force from the beginning.[Pre-Chorus:]We've come too farTo give up who we are,So let's raise the barAnd our cups to the stars.[Chorus:]She's up all night till the sun,I'm up all night to get some.She's up all night for good fun,I'm up all night to get lucky.We're up all night till the sun,We're up all night to get some.We're up all night for good fun,We're up all night to get lucky.[Post-Chorus:]We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.The present has no ribbon,Your gift keeps on giving.What is this I'm feeling?If you want to leave, I'm with it.[All Chorus][Daft Punk Bridge:]We're up all night to get...We're up all night to get...We're up all night to get...We're up all night to get...We're up all night to getWe're up all night (let's get back again).We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get luckWe're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.We're up all night to get lucky.[All Chorus]

Toronto Star," February 9, 2017",Peter Howell," Jarmusch, who made supernatural vampires seem human in Only Lovers Left Alive, now finds inspiration in the mundane."

"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," February 3, 2017",Rob Thomas," Paterson's life sounds like it would be pretty dull to live through, let alone watch in a movie. But in writer-director Jim Jarmusch's hands, ""Paterson"" becomes a fascinating and enthralling film that finds magic in the mundane."
Christianity Today," January 30, 2017",Jeffrey Overstreet," Paterson's bus is non-articulated, but he's as articulate as they come. ... Think Taxi Driver reimagined by Fred Rogers."
The Sunday Age," January 27, 2017",Craig Mathieson," The different Patersons combine into a terrific take on love's abiding worth, the mechanics of creativity and the strength of community. The film has Jarmusch's trademark deadpan deliberation, but it's also possessed of a great and genuine heart."
One Guy's Opinion," January 27, 2017",Frank Swietek, Even those who have resisted Jarmusch's idiosyncratic style in the past may find themselves drawn to this charmingly offbeat ode to the lift that a touch of poetry can bring to an ostensibly mundane existence.

NUVO Newsweekly," January 25, 2017",Edward Johnson-Ott," It's a pleasure to watch, so much so that I've viewed the film several times since receiving a screener copy in December. Paterson is different, distinct, and satisfying, one of the best films of 2016."
The Patriot Ledger," January 21, 2017",Al Alexander," Driver cleverly doles out pieces of Paterson's being in such slow, steady increments that you're surprised by how deeply you've come to love this incredibly average guy."
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," January 20, 2017",John Urbancich," Jarmusch takes us for a week in the life of his bus driver/poet (Driver), a working man with a kooky wife (Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani), a spiteful dog, and pals and acquaintances that help make this film an easy, often charming watch. "
Cambridge Day," January 20, 2017",Tom Meek, Paterson is an exemplar... plumbing the passion for meter and the banality of the everyday while tapping into the rhythm and flow of the human condition.

Collider," May 18, 2016",Talia Soghomonian," Jarmusch is not trying to convey a message, but merely cultivating poetry with a unique texture. And while the pace may feel as slow as the bus's commute through Paterson, it is nevertheless a sublime slice of life in the city of bards."

Daily Telegraph (UK)," May 17, 2016",Tim Robey," The film has incidents rather than plot: disruptions, minor mishaps, happy accidents. How Jarmusch takes this match-stick house of nothings and fills it with such calm and wisdom is a mystery with only one real answer: he's an artist."
The Film Stage," May 16, 2016",Giovanni Marchini Camia," Its restrained aesthetic and Driver's sublime, understated performance render it the director's most recognizably human and poignant film."

Chicago Reader," October 13, 2016",Jonathan Rosenbaum," Like many of Jarmusch's best films, this keeps surprising us with its minimal, witty inflections, at once epic and small-scale."
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," October 12, 2016",Josef Braun," [A] quietly seductive study of a guy named Paterson, a Paterson, New Jersey bus driver played by Adam Driver."

Maclean's Magazine," September 19, 2016",Brian D. Johnson," It's a one-of-a-kind, strangely moving film, and as close as cinema gets to pure poetry."

Observer (UK)," November 27, 2016",Xan Brooks," For all its fine qualities, Paterson feels complacent and self-regarding. It's hard to listen to lectures in modesty from a film that's so busy admiring itself in the mirror."

Shotgun Critic," November 21, 2016",Patrick Kolan, Long-time fans won't be disappointed with Paterson; Jarmusch's trademark dry wit and attention to mood are all over it ... a beautifully modest movie and one of the best portraits of a working-class American you'll ever see. (Reviewer: Chris Neill)
Fan The Fire," November 21, 2016",Martin Roberts," Paterson, for me, succeeds in creating a tone that is very much its own, and by practising exceptional levels of dramatic restraint, delivers a ponderous, thoughtful experience, much like the ones in its protagonist's head."

New York Daily News," December 21, 2016",Amy Rowe," ""Paterson"" is filled with moments and interactions that seem like they're headed toward drama but take a different route. And even though it's set in the present day, Paterson's quaint life evokes an earlier period, adding a thin layer of surrealism."
AV Club," December 21, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Jarmusch, that aging ambassador of cool, sincerely respects both the the ordinariness and the artistry of his blue-collar hero. One does not contradict the other. They are intimately related."
Brooklyn Magazine," December 20, 2016",Eli Goldfarb," Keeping his distance from the granular details of psychic conflict, Jarmusch's domestic idyll veers distressingly close to some kind of working-class virtue fanfic."

The Age (Australia)," December 16, 2016",Jake Wilson," Jarmusch is justly revered as one of the fathers of modern independent American film, but his films have grown ever more wispy and self-congratulatory, Paterson, though artful in its way, is the most cloying of the lot."

Rolling Stone," December 28, 2016",Peter Travers," Adam Driver gives his loveliest, most lyrical performance in this Jim Jarmusch film-one of the year's best-that takes its good, sweet time working its way into your mind and heart. But when it does, you're a goner."

Richard Roeper.com," January 19, 2017",Richard Roeper, Jarmusch is a next-level storyteller with an amazing ability to deliver a scene that works on face value and as a metaphor
Columbus Alive," January 19, 2017",Brad Keefe," It's an unlikely story of the art of the everyday: warm, funny and possessing a lolling rhythm and a great lead performance by Adam Driver."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," January 19, 2017",Colin Covert," Poetry shows us how just a few words can be full of meaning. ""Paterson,"" a tone poem of a film, goes about its business the same way, with simple gestures that contain a lot and work on many levels."
Reeling Reviews," January 19, 2017",Laura Clifford," ...about dreamers, opposites and the deep happiness found in an optimistic view of life."
Arizona Republic," January 19, 2017",Bill Goodykoontz," If it sounds like not much happens in this film, well, have you ever seen a Jim Jarmusch movie?"
Boston Globe," January 19, 2017",Ty Burr," I think Jarmusch has actually remade ""Groundhog Day"" as a work of spiritual ecstasy. I also think Paterson the man may be a Zen Ralph Kramden."
Movie Nation," January 19, 2017",Roger Moore, An aged hipster's take on what a young working class poet might be like...static. Humorless. 
Cleveland Plain Dealer," January 18, 2017",Laura DeMarco, Paterson is a keen observer of the meaning the mundane. As is Jarmusch's poetic film.
Miami Herald," January 18, 2017",Rene Rodriguez, Or would you rather be a fish?
Laramie Movie Scope," January 17, 2017",Robert Roten, The story takes place over the space of one week. Minor triumphs and tragedies that seem exaggerated in importance amid the sameness. There is also some drama in the story because of the crazy things that love does to a person's mind.
Film Freak Central," January 16, 2017",Walter Chaw," Jarmusch was always funny, but there's warmth now, too."
East Bay Express," January 12, 2017",Kelly Vance," Jarmusch's setting, in its heightened sense of the mundane, reminds us unmistakably of the filmmaker's vision of Cleveland, Ohio, in his 1984 breakthrough Stranger Than Paradise."
Willamette Week," January 12, 2017",Ben Ferguson," Patient, watchful and quietly transcendent."
Playback:stl," January 12, 2017",Sarah Boslaugh, A certain type of viewer (particularly white dudes with literary aspirations) will want to jump right into the film and live there...
Seattle Times," January 12, 2017",Tom Keogh," Driver's performance as an uncertain man getting through the day-to-day prosaic, quietly buoyed by passion and artistic commitment, is exquisite."
Philadelphia Inquirer," January 12, 2017",Tirdad Derakhshani," Paterson is easily one of Jarmusch's most accomplished films. He portrays the life of the mind and the workings of the creative soul as a kind of secret love affair, a deep, hidden well inside the most ordinary, mundane existence."

Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",David Turpin," If the film's collection of frissons is ultimately less satisfying than the knockout punch of I am Love, it's still as enjoyable, refreshing, and ever-so-slightly discombobulating as a good holiday."

Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein," Tilda Swinton plays rock star Marianne Lane in A Bigger Splash, a thriller posing as a vacation posing as a commentary on what happens when two men fix their attentions on the same woman."
Film Inquiry," December 7, 2016",Becky Kukla," A Bigger Splash is a lazy, meandering journey which takes its time getting there, but when it arrives it feels worth it. "

Groucho Reviews," September 9, 2016",Peter Canavese," The significant visual appeal and magnetic turns by the leading players make this four-hander a diverting dip into human nature: specifically, jealousy and the folly of opting for interiority over communication."

Common Sense Media," July 1, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," A loose remake of a 1969 French movie, this mature, fascinating character drama is alive in a very sensual way, zeroing in on atmosphere and environment and the way they react with humans."
Thrillist," June 30, 2016",Matt Patches," The mesmerizing photography and ecstatic personality of A Bigger Splash will leave you tipsy, so please, bring a designated driver for this one."
New England Movies Weekly," June 17, 2016",Sean Burns, An amazing thing happened when Ralph Fiennes started going bald because that's when the world found out he's funny.
Radio Times," February 11, 2016",Stephen Carty," The four leads are superb, but Fiennes steals the show, dominating a scene whenever he appears. His dancing, in particular, is a joy to behold."
Independent (UK)," February 11, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, The film makes its hedonistic protagonists seem like characters in a classical tragedy. The intimacy between them becomes more oppressive and results in ever more extreme behaviour. The zest of the film-making belies the darkness at the core here.
Empire Magazine," February 11, 2016",Damon Wise," [The] climax ... ought to be powerful and ironic yet simply falls flat - a crushing damp squib of an ending for a film that begins with a tone of anarchic, irreverent promise."

Variety," September 9, 2015",Peter Debruge," Though this isn't a typical awards-seeking performance from Fiennes, it certainly ranks among the actor's best."

Hollywood Reporter," September 9, 2015",Deborah Young," The film feels empty and intellectualized at the core, where it should feel powerfully emotional."

Screen International," September 9, 2015",Lee Marshall," In this overlong remake of cult 1969 drama La Piscine, Italian director Luca Guadagnino, treading water after the classy, well-received I Am Love, drains all the smouldering Gallic passion and sexual jealousy out of the pool."

The Playlist," September 6, 2015",Jessica Kiang," It's not deep, nor refined, in fact it's kind of trashy at times. But you can still make a solid, buzzy rock 'n' roll album track out of trash, if not quite a hit single."
TheWrap," September 6, 2015",Alonso Duralde, A lush and intriguing experience that works so well for so long that it can't be undone by a few flaws.
The Australian," March 25, 2016",David Stratton," Swinton is terrific and, against the odds, compellingly convincing as a world-famous rock star, while Schoenaerts and Fanning provide crucial support."
FILMINK (Australia)," March 24, 2016",Matthew Lowe," Like the band that it adulates, its best asset is the vulnerability with which it underscores its own sleaze."
Herald Sun (Australia)," March 23, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, The uncomfortable energy which ebbs and flows between this quartet is anything but uncomfortable to witness as a viewer.
Urban Cinefile," March 19, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," The beauty of the women's bodies and the splendor of the location are meant to seduce us, and that is ironic since that seduction is as shallow as the characters"
Urban Cinefile," March 19, 2016",Louise Keller, Carnal pleasures and temptations are integral to this intriguing psychological drama in which intricately bound relationships reveal darker undertones beneath the frivolity
Flicks.co.nz," March 10, 2016",Matt Glasby," Best thought of as a sort of Euro-centric Sexy Beast - Sexy Beasts, perhaps."
ABC Radio (Australia)," March 7, 2016",CJ Johnson," A sun-kissed vine of a film, whose plot (which is really incredibly slight) is entirely subservient to its presentation, on an antipasto platter, of four excellent performances."
The Film Stage," February 21, 2016",Zhuo-Ning Su," A sweaty, kinetic, dangerously unpredictable ride of a film."

Daily Express (UK)," February 14, 2016",Allan Hunter," Ralph Fiennes is the life and soul of the party in A Bigger Splash, which is just as well because it is a fairly dull party."
Observer (UK)," February 14, 2016",Mark Kermode, Guadagnino has cruel fun allowing an excellent core cast (all of whom he has apparently asked to return in his forthcoming remake of Dario Argento's Suspiria) to spiral into ghastly self-destruction.
Movie Talk," February 13, 2016",Jason Best, Guadagnino's movie shares with [Deray's film and Hockney's painting] a mood of eerie languor and sun-baked hedonism. Which makes the disruptive energy provided by Fiennes' exuberant and garrulous interloper all the more startling.
Sky Movies," February 11, 2016",Tim Evans, It's a compelling watch as Guadagnino darkens the tone from sunny farce to something far darker as the quartet surrender sexually to their urges in a way that ensures nobody winds up a winner.

New York Times," May 3, 2016",Manohla Dargis," Mr. Guadagnino excels at creating lifestyle pornography of an especially rarefied kind, although in classic European style, he gilds the pleasure with some political guilt."
Den of Geek," May 3, 2016",Edward Douglas," Guadagnino's latest thrives on its performances and gorgeous scenery, but will probably be an acquired taste."
Film Comment Magazine," May 3, 2016",Michael Sragow," In A Bigger Splash, Fiennes uses all his showmanship, imagination, and empathy to vitalize a character who is both the life of the party-and, in one uncanny twist, the death of it."
New York Post," May 3, 2016",Lou Lumenick, A steamy and satisfying kickoff to the summer film season on the art-house circuit.
Brooklyn Magazine," May 2, 2016",Keith Uhlich," You don't just need, per Jean-Luc Godard, a gun and a girl for a movie. Beautiful people in a beautiful location suffices."
Slant Magazine," May 2, 2016",Steve Macfarlane," What intrigues, if in a lurid sort of way, is the film's fudging of projected viewer desires with its characters'."
New Yorker," May 2, 2016",Anthony Lane, Luca Guadagnino has made something rare and disconcerting: a genuinely pagan film.
ABC Radio Brisbane," May 2, 2016",Matthew Toomey, It's a curious piece and you're never quite sure which characters have the upper hand. It makes the ending even more intriguing.

Trespass," April 6, 2016",Alex Doenau," This Mediterranean holiday piece has many elements that conspire towards greatness, but its core is as empty as a drained swimming pool."
Sensacine," April 5, 2016",Israel Paredes, The filmmaker narrates from a 'conventional' plot scheme to build a series of scenes that's both imaginative and attentive to detail. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Straits Times (Singapore)," April 1, 2016",John Lui," Sit back, smell the jasmine and take it all in without thinking too much about it."
Sydney Morning Herald," March 30, 2016",Jake Wilson," With a bit more restraint, A Bigger Splash could have had the elegant menace of a Patricia Highsmith novel. But Guadagnino goes to town with studiously excessive stylistic flourishes."
Rip It Up," March 29, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," This overheated, extravagant and indulgent epic (a sort of remake of Jacques Deray's La Piscine -- perhaps) is often fun, although after a while you do wind up wanting to strangle the cast in desperation. "
The Sunday Age," March 25, 2016",Craig Mathieson," An arresting film with a quartet of terrific performances, led by Fiennes. Guadagnino's English-language debut is essential viewing. Dive in."
Consequence of Sound," May 11, 2016",Blake Goble," By taking what's ostensibly a hazy love-in, and deconstructing it into a song of sadness and forced frolicking, Guadagnino has devised a bewitching masquerade. And the water's so inviting."
Movie Nation," May 11, 2016",Roger Moore," The more we see of Dakota Johnson, the less interesting she becomes. "
Flavorwire," May 9, 2016",Jason Bailey," The mood is simultaneously idyllic and tense, deceptively casual and off-handedly sensual, with wandering gazes and thoughts leading to some particularly potent psychosexual mind games."
Compuserve," May 7, 2016",Harvey S. Karten, One of Ralph Fiennes's best performances and the gorgeous scenery on a Sicilian island doesn't hurt.
The Atlantic," May 6, 2016",David Sims," A Bigger Splash is a sensuous delight of a film, but it has a darker heart that brands itself in the viewer's mind. "
Tolucan Times," May 5, 2016",Tony Medley," ...even though it is a lot of talk, there is an underlying tension constantly onscreen that the characters are cascading towards something bad. Particularly effective is Dakota Johnson who creates an extremely disturbing femme fatale."
Tribune News Service," May 5, 2016",Katie Walsh," A kooky, sexy, rollicking, and eventually, quite dark, romp through a sun-sizzled Sicilian vacation. Jump on in-the water's fine, though, swim at your own risk."
Associated Press," May 5, 2016",Jocelyn Noveck," Watch Fiennes dance rapturously to the Stones' ""Emotional Rescue."" It's a cliche, but we'll say it: It's worth the price of admission."
RogerEbert.com," May 5, 2016",Christy Lemire," Simultaneously lush and lurid, sumptuous and startling, ""A Bigger Splash"" never goes where you expect, even as its undercurrent of danger is unmistakable from the start."
Bullz-Eye.com," May 5, 2016",Jack Giroux," A Bigger Splash is a richly made and thoughtful character study, and one that'll probably grow deeper with each viewing."
AV Club," May 5, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," The cast is uniformly strong, and willing to go wherever Guadagnino takes them, in however little clothing he deems necessary; the ensemble-wide equal-opportunity nudity is almost frequent enough to qualify as confrontational."
Paste Magazine," May 4, 2016",Kenji Fujishima," These characters and their predicaments become more involving the longer we observe their interactions, picking up clues to their past, scrutinizing their faces and words to get a sense of their feelings toward each other."
USA Today," May 4, 2016",Brian Truitt, An interesting dip into a pool of intrigue.
indieWire," May 4, 2016",David Ehrlich," It's a messy romp that's funny, hot, and horrifying in equal measure; and if it squeaks a bit whenever it tries to shift gears, that sound just becomes another instrument in Guadagnino's latest symphony of the senses. "
Rolling Stone," May 4, 2016",Peter Travers," Everything in this spellbinding erotic dance is so ripe and voluptuous that watching it doesn't seem enough, you want to take a bite out of it. "
PopMatters," May 4, 2016",Chris Barsanti," ... delivers a lush, narcotic charge"
AtHomeInHollywood.com," May 4, 2016",Staci Layne Wilson," A long, strange trip well worth taking. Crank it up!"
Village Voice," May 4, 2016",Melissa Anderson," Not even this flamboyant project, however satisfying in its excesses otherwise, can accommodate the inept civics lesson."

3AW," May 14, 2016",Jim Schembri," Talented Italian director Luca Guadagnino shows broader, coarser interests here than he did with I Am Love as he plucks away at the vapourous notions of love, lust and desire."
National Post," May 13, 2016",Sadaf Ahsan," Awash as it is in sun-kissed skin and pastels, the entire film reeks of release, providing the kind of cinematic climax that may just rival whatever real life has to offer."
Boston Herald," May 13, 2016",James Verniere," Food, drink , sex, sun, beautiful bodies, great music and a scene stealing turn from Fiennes."

Globe and Mail," May 13, 2016",Brad Wheeler," Inspired by the film La Piscine, script writer David Kajganich crafted a cleverly building story. Director Guadagnino uses an impending windstorm to achieve a sense of apprehension as back-stories and true intentions are revealed."
Philadelphia Inquirer," May 13, 2016",Steven Rea," A tale of love and jealousy, obsession and seduction, A Bigger Splash takes its time getting where it's actually going ... but that's all right."
Beliefnet," May 12, 2016",Nell Minow," It's a mood piece, brilliantly performed."
Toronto Sun," May 12, 2016",Liz Braun," Even when the story turns dark, much remains unsaid, unresolved and ambiguous. Four great performances bring the whole thing to life."

JoBlo's Movie Emporium," May 12, 2016",Chris Bumbray," All style over substance, but the movie is gorgeous and Ralph Fiennes is excellent. "
Washington Post," May 12, 2016",Ann Hornaday," To speak or stay silent? Excess or restraint? Honesty or discretion? It's clear which is right and which is wrong, but ""A Bigger Splash"" manages to infuse even the most straightforward questions with vicariously alluring ambiguity."
NOW Toronto," May 12, 2016",Susan G. Cole, Mesmerizingly beautiful and sexy.
Arizona Republic," May 12, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," It's a feast for the senses, as they say, and for once, that's not hyperbole."
BuzzFeed News," May 11, 2016",Alison Willmore," Luca Guadagnino makes movies that feel like they're on ecstasy. They have a stick-your-head-in-a-speaker-and-insist-you-can-feel-the-music buzz to them, sensory details cranked up until they all but leap off the screen."

Willamette Week," May 19, 2016",Ezra Johnson-Greenough," While the film is billed as a suspenseful, erotic thriller, it's more of a character study that builds to a surprising climax"
CinemaBlend.com," May 19, 2016",Conner Schwerdtfeger," The film ultimately finds itself saved by director Luca Guadagnino's strong sense of style, and the sheer commitment of the film's lead actors."
Cambridge Day," May 19, 2016",Tom Meek," It's an embarrassment of riches that gets close to the point of going over the edge, but the cast rein it back in to the base human elements we can't all afford to indulge in with our landlocked budgets."

Fort Worth Weekly," June 3, 2016",Kristian M. Lin, A Bigger Splash is cutting social satire in a manner familiar from decades of Italian cinema. The sexiness and star power here help it all go down easily.
Seven Days," June 2, 2016",Rick Kisonak," Fiennes' Harry is a fabulous character, a human whirlwind and walking, talking bacchanal who doesn't so much disturb the peace that his hosts are enjoying as turn up the volume on their insular lives. It's a fantastic performance. "
Missoula Independent," June 2, 2016",Molly Laich, I'm recommending A Bigger Splash on the strength of its performances and the complexity of the characters. 
Your Movies (cleveland.com)," May 29, 2016",John Urbancich," ""The disappointing ending just about destroys all the trashy goodwill accumulated by Ralph Fiennes et al. in a randy ditty that might have been called a skin flick in another time and place."""

Sacramento News & Review," May 27, 2016",Daniel Barnes, [It's] an overinflated genre film highly dependent on magnetic performances to hold it together. Swinton is up to the task.

Salt Lake Tribune," May 26, 2016",Sean P. Means," The cast is strong, with Swinton particularly powerful even though her voice barely rises above a whisper."
Fresno Bee," May 26, 2016",Rick Bentley," It takes a tour de force performance to stand out in a film that features compelling performances by Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts and Dakota Johnson. They are so good that even when Fiennes is not on screen, the quality never waivers."

Newsweek," September 22, 2016",Tom Shone," [Howard seems] as if he were intent on making a film for anyone who tuned in to The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, fell in love with the four adorable mop tops and regrets all the long-haired plonking about with sitars that came later."
Indie London," September 22, 2016",Rob Carnevale," A breezy, celebratory piece that recaptures the energy of the band in their prime."

ABC Radio (Australia)," September 20, 2016",CJ Johnson," There is little here that was not done better in The Beatles Anthology (1995) ... [but] it's still two hours in the company of four of the most enjoyable people ever ... [and] this time, instead of the girls, we hear the band."
Irish Independent," September 19, 2016",Paul Whitington," Howard's film unearths startling footage of them performing, and fades out the awful screaming so you can actually hear them play. They were pretty good, it turns out."
New Yorker," September 19, 2016",Anthony Lane," The Beatles now belong to an honored past, stuck there like an obelisk, and yet here they are, alive-busting out all over, time and time again. Yeah, yeah, yeah."

TheShiznit.co.uk," January 1, 2017",Ed Williamson," A timely, important documentary, packed with unfamiliar footage and using a refreshingly new approach, just as concerned with recording a remarkable cultural flashpoint as a musical revolution."
Financial Times," December 28, 2016",Nigel Andrews," The songs are still great. The foursome's waggish chemistry is still a wonder. But there's a lot of old ground, even old grind."
Total Film," December 28, 2016",Ali Catterall," Given the subject matter, this still feels fresh thanks to rare/unseen footage."
ArtsHub," December 4, 2016",Sarah Ward," As excitement is relived, flames of fondness re-fanned and toes kept tapping, so is an appreciation for the artistry behind the acclaim."
Cinexcepción," November 29, 2016",Hugo Hernández Valdivia," A sort of popular film for young people; the richness of the documentary is in the music and the personalities of the members, as it offers little news for fans. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cine Premiere," November 23, 2016",Julio Vélez," A documentary that fans of all ages will enjoy because it's a nostalgic experience that you can't miss, and that will never be enjoyed in the living room as much as you could in a movie seat. [Full review in Spanish]"
Daily Express (UK)," November 9, 2016",Henry Fitzherbert," New fans will be immersed in the full force of Beatlemania; oldies will enjoy a nostalgic look at a pop culture maelstrom, the like of which we've never seen before or since."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," November 2, 2016",John Lui," Watching the band play, with showman skills honed to perfection in clubs in Hamburg and Liverpool, is a treat; to see them play in full colour and restored audio is a revelation."

Times (UK)," October 10, 2016",Kate Muir," The material is uncontroversial to say the least, but hugely enjoyable with some remastered live performances that were previously drowned out by screaming girl fans."
South China Morning Post," October 7, 2016",Richard James Havis," Beatles fans are in for an enjoyable, if unenlightening, viewing experience, while those who don't know much about them will find it a Fab Four 101."
Seanax.com," October 6, 2016",Sean Axmaker, It's also about something that most documentaries miss: the brotherhood of four Liverpool lads who pulled together because there was no one else to count on when after becoming international superstars.
NOW Toronto," October 5, 2016",Susan G. Cole, Will the documentary play to those who didn't grow up with the Beatles? My guess is that it doesn't really matter. It'll do just fine thanks just to a generation that will never let the Beatles go.

Urban Cinefile," October 3, 2016",Louise Keller," I tapped my toes throughout Ron Howard's fabulous documentary that gives a real sense of the time, the Beatles' talent and the Beatle-mania that sweeps the world in the 60s ...

Flavorwire," October 2, 2016",Jason Bailey," If you're a Beatles fan - and that's who a movie like this is for - you've already seen most of this stuff, and diehards (and I speak as one myself) will probably find themselves focusing more on Howard's stranger choices."
EntertainmentTell," September 27, 2016",Stephen Silver," Not a whole lot new or illuminating, but on the other hand it's nearly two hours of Beatles music and concert footage (Splice Today) "
Little White Lies," September 7, 2016",Ed Gibbs," A fresh, thoughtful look at the world's favourite quartet."
Variety," August 16, 2016",Guy Lodge," Taken on [its own] limited terms, ""Eight Days a Week"" plays nicely enough: the mostly uptempo Side A of a well-stocked greatest hits album, as it were."
Screen International," August 16, 2016",Fionnuala Halligan," This infectious piece harks back to happier, sweeter times for the Beatles and for pop music in general."

Daily Mail (UK)," August 13, 2016",Brian Viner," With the help of some obvious talking heads, and some less predictable ones, [Howard] tells a familiar tale with a surprising and at times thrilling amount of originality."
Uncut Magazine [UK]," August 12, 2016",Michael Bonner," Martin Scorsese's George Harrison's documentary is still the closest at capturing the full-tilt craziness of being in The Beatles, but Howard's film provides a robust companion piece."

Boston Globe," September 14, 2016",Ty Burr, Take the kids and watch their little minds get blown.
Seattle Times," September 14, 2016",Paul de Barros," By using home-movie footage in hotel rooms, fly-on-the-wall tape from the studio control room, Howard's film often succeeds in making you feel it all from the four lads' astonished point of view."
Cinemaclips.com," September 14, 2016",Roger Tennis," Ron Howard's pitch-perfect documentary is a fabulous love letter to past, present and future fans of the Fab Four."
Consequence of Sound," September 14, 2016",Dominick Mayer," There's a lot of joy to go around in Eight Days a Week, to such a degree that the film might have verged on feeling like a puff piece, were it not about perhaps the only rock band that's ever wholly justified the endless time spent fixated upon it."
Reeling Reviews," September 14, 2016",Laura Clifford, Think you've seen all there is to see on the Beatles from that endearingly irreverent press conference after their U.S. arrival to the Ed Sullivan Show to the fans screaming so loudly during concerts one couldn't hear the music? Think again.

Daily Telegraph (UK)," September 13, 2016",Robbie Collin," The phenomenon of their live appearances - not just the concerts themselves, but the cheeky press-conference preludes, and the hysterical, garment-rending fallout - itself defines the era with a spiky precision."
Student Edge," September 12, 2016",Simon Miraudo," We don't learn anything new from The Beatles - Eight Days a Week (besides Whoopi Goldberg's feelings on the Fab Four), but its restored live footage might warrant a ticket to ride."
Killer Movie Reviews," September 12, 2016",Andrea Chase," It's at once an intimate look from the inside out about what it was like to be them, and a literate consideration from the outside in on their impact on the culture."

The Arts Desk," September 9, 2016",James Woodall," If it's about or based on The Beatles, the question is always the same: how on earth can anything new be said? In the case of Ron Howard's Eight Days a Week: The Touring Years, surprisingly quite a lot, is the answer."

Austin Chronicle," September 8, 2016",Marjorie Baumgarten," With the Beatles' company Apple Corps as one of the producing partners, Howard's access to original material was presumably nonpareil. And with a subject as rich as the Beatles, ""you know that can't be bad."""

Independent (UK)," September 15, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, What makes the film magical is the sheer richness of the archive material and the pace at which it has been edited. The documentary never feels like an exercise in nostalgia.
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," September 15, 2016",Vicky Roach," Ron Howard's feature-length documentary, the first to be authorised by the band since its breakup in 1970, offers audiences a well-paced and thoroughly engaging recap."
MovieMail," September 15, 2016",Mike McCahill," Howard's film is a little less essential, all told -- but watching as a fan myself, I felt fine."
Willamette Week," September 15, 2016",Nathan Carson," Howard can't help but overshoot the mark here, extending the story into a bit more of a biography than the subtitle calls for, but that's also what makes this film a worthwhile gateway for the uninitiated."

Chicago Sun-Times," September 15, 2016",Mark Caro," Howard is more interested in wowing audiences with exuberant, hysteria-ridden performances than he is in digging for explanations."
Chicago Reader," September 15, 2016",J. R. Jones," The familiar events presented here were covered more thoroughly in the band's own 11-hour Beatles Anthology, though Howard has dug up some good ancillary concert footage that illustrates the chaos swirling around every show."
Metro," September 15, 2016",Matt Prigge," Do The Beatles need another documentary? Maybe! Someone forgot to tell millennials about the Fab Four, and so the greatest, most famous band in history might be finally on the verge of becoming as well known as ELO or Van Der Graaf Generator."
Newark Star-Ledger," September 15, 2016",Stephen Whitty," As someone who's been a fan since 5, twisting away in my living room to their Ed Sullivan appearance, there isn't much I haven't seen. Or thought I hadn't. But Howard still digs up surprises ..."
Arizona Republic," September 15, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," I've heard ""Rubber Soul"" and ""Revolver"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" probably thousands of times, too, and I still like hearing them. So it is with Howard's movie - the story is so incredibly good, it's worth repeating."

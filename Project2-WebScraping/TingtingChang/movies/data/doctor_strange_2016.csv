Japan Times," January 18, 2017",Kaori Shoji," OK, so Dr. Strange is not as soulful as expected. But in this particular reality, I'll take what I can get."
Film Experience," January 2, 2017",Nathaniel Rogers, Doctor Strange's last act is so trippy and exciting that you can almost forgive that generic story.
Washington City Paper," January 2, 2017",Matt Cohen," Though Doctor Strange's impressive visual effects and head-spinning mythology might seem a bit much for Marvel's typical filmgoing crowd, its story is rudimentary enough to keep the more far-reaching elements relatively grounded."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack, The movie is very much Harry Potter for adults.
Hindustan Times," December 31, 2016",Rashid Irani, [An] underwhelming panel-to-screen Marvel adaptation.
Daily Star," December 31, 2016",Andy Lea, This summer's superhero films may have fallen a bit flat but this one is magic.
Globe and Mail," December 31, 2016",Barry Hertz," Doctor Strange, intended to be a mind-bending, rule-breaking rebuke to the squares of superhero cinema, turns out to be a rebel in name only -- the textbook definition of a bad trip."
TIME Magazine," December 31, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Cumberbatch, both a natural comedian and a subtle one, knows how to get a big laugh from nothing more than an arched eyebrow."
The Mary Sue," December 31, 2016",Jessica Lachenal, The overall experience of Doctor Strange is wonderfully fun... provided you don't try to dig a little deeper.
Columbus Alive," December 30, 2016",Brad Keefe," Doctor Strange is another win for Marvel, and proof that there are some new tricks to be found in superhero movies after all."
Cinema Movil," December 28, 2016",Oscar Uriel," A clear example of an amazing and commited cast, that take their work seriously, no matter how silly the premise is. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Sunday Age," December 27, 2016",Craig Mathieson," For all the talk of alternate dimensions and sightings of a bald Tilda Swinton, Scott Derrickson's film is a sturdy addition to the superhero saga that's been slotting in compatible pieces since Iron Man delivered its first wisecrack in 2008."
El Financiero," December 22, 2016",Daniel Krauze, Dr. Strange is not only entertaining and absurd. It's also an intelligent film. [Full review in Spanish]
Reel Film Reviews," December 22, 2016",David Nusair, Quite possibly the worst of the Marvel movies...
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Camilla Long," Strip away the thick rind of make-up and the comedy Hugh Laurie accent, and Strange is exactly like every role Cumberbatch has ever played."
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 17, 2016",Tim Brayton, It's not a tremendously rewarding piece of storytelling... But it's dang cool.
leonardmaltin.com," December 15, 2016",Leonard Maltin," My reaction to this movie is mixed, at best."
MovieCrypt.com," December 6, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson," Strange can do great things by the end of the movie, but he still has a lot to learn before he can take on the title of Sorcerer Supreme - and that should be fun to watch, too."
Matt's Movie Reviews," December 6, 2016",Matthew Pejkovic, Brings much in the way of tasty popcorn spirituality to match it's brilliant filmmaking.
Film Inquiry," December 5, 2016",Julia Smith," Dr Strange isn't just any old superhero, he's not gaudy and violent, he's smarter, he's gentler. He's basically a much nicer Sherlock... in a cape."
Variety," October 23, 2016",Peter Debruge," The key is an in-on-the-joke script, which Derrickson co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, that ingeniously navigates major plot potholes even as it saddles its actors with ludicrous dialogue. But what actors!"
The Playlist," October 23, 2016",Gregory Ellwood, A visual wonder... but you still feel the formula straining.
ScreenCrush," October 23, 2016",Matt Singer, Marvel's familiar formula with some really cool visuals.
The Daily Beast," October 23, 2016",Jen Yamato, More mature than its predecessors and the first blockbuster of the modern superhero era ideally viewed on a magic mushroom trip.
TheWrap," October 23, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Casts a few impressive spells of its own, not the least of which is the redemption of the visual-effects extravaganza. This funny, freaky adventure reminds us of how effective VFX can be when they've got some imagination behind them."
Uproxx," October 23, 2016",Mike Ryan," Doctor Strange is basically a reboot of Iron Man, only with a lot more prettier things to look at while you're stoned. It's a good strategy. And it works."
Independent (UK)," October 24, 2016",Jack Shepherd," Director Scott Derrickson creates a cinematic experience straight from the comic books, an incredible feat that needs to be seen on the big screen."
GQ Magazine [UK]," October 24, 2016",Helen O'Hara," Happily, it's [Marvel 's] most impressive visual film yet."
Entertainment Weekly," October 24, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, Doctor Strange is thrilling in the way a lot of other Marvel movies are. But what makes it unique is that it's also heady in a way most Marvel movies don't dare to be.
CraveOnline," October 24, 2016",William Bibbiani," At its best it's a consciousness-expanding head trip of fantastic proportions, and at its worst it's merely an entertaining superhero movie."
Sci-Fi Movie Page," October 24, 2016",Rob Vaux," When you add the unique visuals that a character like this can facilitate, it makes Doctor Strange one of the more interesting entries in Hollywood's 600-lb. gorilla of a franchise."
The Skinny," October 24, 2016",Joseph Walsh, Doctor Strange is a psychedelic extravaganza that's sure to spin heads with its trippy effects and tongue-and-cheek wit.
Guardian," October 24, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," It's a tremendously engaging and likeable superhero ride, in which the classiest of casts show they know exactly where to take it seriously - and where to inject the fun."
Forbes," October 24, 2016",Scott Mendelson," The visuals are worth the price of admission, but this is as generic and by-the-numbers an origin story as the MCU has ever made. It's better than 'Green Lantern,' but it will remind you of 'Green Lantern'. "
HeyUGuys," October 24, 2016",Stefan Pape, Fantastic and brilliant! The effects will blow your mind!
Total Film," October 24, 2016",James Mottram," Cumberbatch fits Doctor Strange like a pair of snap-tight surgical gloves, in yet another MCU triumph. Beautifully designed, brilliantly executed."
Time Out," October 24, 2016",Tom Huddleston," Derrickson promised this would be 'weird and wild', and so it is - at least within the context of a major Hollywood blockbuster."
Digital Spy," October 24, 2016",Rosie Fletcher, Doctor Strange is a movie very much built up of other movies yet it still manages to keep its own identity.
Movies.com," October 23, 2016",Erik Davis," ""At times it will leave you in awe of what you're watching unfold in front of your eyes."""
CinemaBlend.com," October 23, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," There are certainly shades of Iron Man and Thor, but what the film brings to the table to balance out its familiar elements is some of the most bombastic, exciting and beautiful action sequences we've seen in modern blockbusters."
Screen International," October 23, 2016",Tim Grierson," Entertaining in its grand flourishes but spottier when it comes to character work and thematic coherence, the film boasts a slightly darker and more mystical air than its peers, accentuated by some of the most arresting set pieces in the MCU canon."
Den of Geek," October 23, 2016",Don Kaye," The acting, the visual fireworks and Michael Giacchino's distinctive, Eastern-influenced score all go a long way toward disguising the fact that we are once again watching an origin story, and one that seems even a bit more perfunctory than usual."
indieWire," October 23, 2016",David Ehrlich," If ""Doctor Strange"" can be dispiritingly safe, it can also be just as impressively bold - an hallucinogenic trip along a very familiar path, watching the film is like adding a large dose of LSD to your morning commute."
IGN Movies," October 23, 2016",Eric Goldman, What really ends up making Doctor Strange an entertaining film are the actors and the visuals.
Hollywood Reporter," October 23, 2016",Todd McCarthy," An engaging, smartly cast and sporadically eye-popping addition to the studio's bulging portfolio."
USA Today," October 23, 2016",Brian Truitt, A kaleidoscope of weirdness and innovative visual effects successfully introduce the newest Marvel superhero in director/co-writer Scott Derrickson's brilliantly bizarre Doctor Strange.
Herald Sun (Australia)," October 26, 2016",Leigh Paatsch, It is not often creative ambition and actual execution rise together to such atmospheric heights.
The Straits Times (Singapore)," October 26, 2016",John Lui, It becomes clear why Cumberbatch was sought for the part. He is perhaps the most gifted of the Marvel recruits... His only equal in acting facility is Iron Man's Robert Downey Jr.
Shotgun Critic," October 26, 2016",Patrick Kolan," However, it achieves a flavor of its own; it feels like its own unique superheroic proposition, and that's impressive in its own right. Frankly, I'd take this spiffy red cape over Clark Kent's any day of the week."
FILMINK (Australia)," October 26, 2016",Erin Free," Itâ(TM)s exciting, entertaining, goofy, and fun..."
Urban Cinefile," October 26, 2016",Louise Keller," Mind-bending effects, jaw-gaping action sequences and a cast with pedigree enable Marvel's Doctor Strange to soar through its many dimensions & parallel universes to a cinematic 3D Shangri-la. "
South China Morning Post," October 25, 2016",James Mottram," The engrossing 3D visuals are superbly conceived, like Inception times 1,000, as buildings start to fold in on themselves, kaleidoscope-style."
Fan The Fire," October 25, 2016",Martin Roberts," The film is in some ways a triumph, but as a whole lacks the cohesion and charm of some of Marvel's other comic book adaptations."
Irish Times," October 25, 2016",Tara Brady, Nimble dialogue and a constellation of capable - if mostly whitewashed - stars ensure this is a rather livelier creation than this year's Captain America: Civil War.
RTÉ (Ireland)," October 25, 2016",Laura Delaney, Doctor Strange isn't as Marvel-ous as fans would like but it sets up nicely for a promising sequel.
The List," October 25, 2016",Kevin Harley," Weaponised by dynamic scripting, the A-class cast sell the concoction well."
CineVue," October 25, 2016",Ben Nicholson," Grounds its outrageousness with an undercurrent of knowing sarcasm, much like its winning star."
Little White Lies," October 25, 2016",Manuela Lazic," At long last - a light, funny superhero movie that embraces the fantasy aspects of the genre in both its story and form."
iNews.co.uk," October 25, 2016",Matthew Turner," Like Inception mashed with M.C. Escher: the richly imaginative visual design is endlessly entertaining in its depiction of astral planes, mirror dimensions and multiverses."
Blog de cine," October 24, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, Marvel has known how to introduce a new character and significantly expand the universe in a very effective way. [Full review in Spanish]
Cinemanía (Spain)," October 24, 2016",Yago García," A film with amazing visuals, a modest script and a wonderful cast. [Full review in Spanish]"
Sensacine," October 24, 2016",Alejandro G. Calvo," A purely fantastic film that reaffirms Marvel's ability to reformulate itself, maintaining an organic base for all its projects. [Full review in Spanish]"
SciFiNow," October 24, 2016",Poppy-Jay Palmer, Two hours of Strange being confused at the ins and outs of the Astral Plane would have been just as satisfying as the actual film. This is the new VFX bar to reach.
Empire Magazine," October 24, 2016",James Dyer," A bizarre and beautiful detour on the Marvel journey, which culminates in a mind-bending, expectation-inverting final act."
Daily Express (UK)," October 24, 2016",Stefan Kyriazis, The smart script and trio of clever British thespians do their best to puncture any pomposity and there are some nice throw away lines about funny teas and wifi passwords. And yet...
Daily Telegraph (UK)," October 24, 2016",Tim Robey," Thankfully, amid all the film's wacky-trippy bending of space and time, [Cumberbatch] manages to steer an ideal path -- taking the role seriously but allowing himself to be flummoxed by it, wittily traumatised and taken off-guard."
Concrete Playground," October 27, 2016",Tom Glasson," Visually, this is Inception dialled up to eleven, a world-bending, shape-shifting and time-distorting Escher painting filled with heroes and villains duelling over the possibility of immortality."
International Business Times," October 27, 2016",Amy West, Surprisingly funny and arguably [Marvel's] most audacious film to date.
Trespass," October 27, 2016",Alex Doenau," With a charismatic lead and almost infinite potential for future set pieces, it's nice to think that we could have another blockbusting dynamo on our hands."
Sky Movies," October 27, 2016",Andy Psyllides," Yes the overarching plot is a familiar one and some of the A-list supporting players get precious little to chew on (Mads Mikkelsen is particularly short-changed as the Darth Vader-like Kaecilius), but Doc Strange does the job and then some."
Newsweek," October 27, 2016",Tufayel Ahmed, Like previous expository Marvel films much of Doctor Strange is devoted to Cumberbatch acquainting himself with his new powers. But the film's visual mindbending is what sets it apart from the studio's past releases.
Scotsman," October 27, 2016",Alistair Harkness, Mostly ... this is a weird and witty breath of fresh air- and as a bonus it also finds a neat solution to the excessive third-act destruction of The Avengers/Captain America films without stinting on spectacle.
Radio Times," October 27, 2016",Alan Jones, Forget all you know or think you know about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ... Derrickson has blown the glitter dust off one of its second-string superheroes and provided him with a barnstorming origin story ...
Daily Mail (UK)," October 27, 2016",Brian Viner, Doctor Strange is mostly a blast.
Daily Express (UK)," October 27, 2016",Allan Hunter, Doctor Strange does have the good sense not to take itself too seriously and there is a welcome sense of humour running through it with a string of witty asides from Cumberbatch.
Flicks.co.nz," October 27, 2016",Steve Newall, Doctor Strange boasts the most mind-bending visual effects I've ever seen...
BuzzFeed News," October 27, 2016",Alison Willmore," It's imperfect, but it's enjoyable, and it sure looks good."
Forbes," October 27, 2016",Mark Hughes," [A] masterpiece of comic book cinema... part Iron Man, part The Matrix, part The Conjuring, and part Harry Potter [with] a dash of Inception, a pinch of Nightmare on Elm Street, [and] a hint of Hero..."
Independent (UK)," October 27, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab, The actors are skilled enough to make us intensely curious about their back stories and for us to accept some of their more preposterous lines of dialogue.
We Got This Covered," October 27, 2016",Matt Donato," Doctor Strange is all about the razzle-dazzle, where spectacle elements are good enough to save a more clunky, weightless Marvel origin story."
Film School Rejects," October 27, 2016",Jacob Oller, Don't let the goatee fool you - this is no Iron Man.
MovieWeb," October 27, 2016",Julian Roman, Doctor Strange will obliterate your expectations. It is an enormously entertaining film; a rousing cinematic adventure loaded with stunning visual effects.
Financial Times," October 27, 2016",Nigel Andrews," With mystical exposition and cod philosophising growing by the minute, our senses are gratefully rescued by flashy fits of special effects."
Flick Filosopher," October 27, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson, Busy with CGI to hide the emptiness where the emotional core should be. Even the mechanics of getting a man from mere mortal to demigod-in-a-cape are rote.
The Standard," October 26, 2016",Matt Neal," MARVEL Studios is becoming increasingly like Evel Knievel - with every successful stunt it lands, it makes the next one bigger and more difficult."
Student Edge," October 26, 2016",Simon Miraudo," With viewer (and creative) fatigue setting in, to whom can Marvel Studios turn to for re-invigoration? A cocky doctor with mystical, mind-expanding powers and even more mystical facial hair? Sure, that'll kill two hours."
The Ooh Tray," October 30, 2016",Ed Whitfield," The film feels more programmed than written, more pre-visualised than directed."
Observer (UK)," October 30, 2016",Wendy Ide, Cumberbatch makes the least immediately likable of the Marvel heroes into the most unpredictable and intriguing.
Epoch Times," October 28, 2016",Mark Jackson, 'Dr. Strange' is the first Marvel movie to tell the reality-based version of where superpowers come from. Science takes human supernormal abilities seriously now-exciting stuff.
El Pais (Spain)," October 28, 2016",Javier Ocaña, An unconventional film with a good soundtrack and lots of digital effects filled with madness. [Full review in Spanish]
Junkee," October 28, 2016",Paul Verhoeven," The VFX are the best I've seen in any Marvel movie, ever. If you do see Doctor Strange -- and you really ought to -- I recommend seeing it at IMAX."
BBC.com," October 28, 2016",Nicholas Barber," Despite focusing on one of the company's less famous and more bizarre characters, it is all too familiar for a film with 'Strange' in the title. Still, none of that stops it being thoroughly enjoyable."
New Zealand Herald," October 28, 2016",Russell Baillie," This doctor, it seems, has a cure for superhero fatigue."
Bangkok Post," October 28, 2016",Kanin Srimaneekulroj," The film's otherworldly quality and excellent comedic moments brings to mind Guardians Of The Galaxy in terms of its inventiveness, bringing us a fresher, stranger (I'm sorry. It's right there!) version of the Marvel films we know and love. "
The Australian," October 28, 2016",Stephen Romei," Doctor Strange, the 14th film in the franchise based on Marvel comic books, is one of the funniest of recent times, lifted beyond the ordinary world, as befits the story, by a superb cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role."
Irish Independent," October 28, 2016",Ed Power," Cumberbatch is magnetic as egotistical neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, who, seeking to reverse the disastrous effects of a car accident, is plunged into a trippy Neverland of parallel dimensions and cosmic conflict."
Contactmusic.com," October 28, 2016",Rich Cline," Yes, Doctor Strange will change the tone of Marvel movies going forward, and that's a very good thing."
The Arts Desk," October 28, 2016",Saskia Baron," Doctor Strange could descend into a clutch of clichés, but director/writer Scott Derrickson has injected plenty of wit. The visuals, especially in the modern-world sequences, are stunning."
Nerdist," October 28, 2016",Michael Arbeiter," Spectacle is as important a character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as its caped crusaders, and never before has this proved such a significant truth."
The Verge," October 28, 2016",Bryan Bishop," Perhaps it's just that there's a little too much Marvel Studios in Doctor Strange, when the strongest thing about the film are the filmmakers hired to bring it to life."
Cine Premiere," October 28, 2016",Sergio López Aguirre, We are facing a visually unique film that will fuse Marvel's mystical and galactic sides together. [Full review in Spanish]
Butaca Ancha," October 28, 2016",JJ Negrete," Not even a sorcerer as powerful as Dr. Strange is able to break Marvel's spell, which continues with the same kind of villains and weak female counterparts. [Full review in Spanish]"
Village Voice," October 28, 2016",Alan Scherstuhl," It's not all that strange, but it's restlessly arresting and always technically impressive. Unlike most studio franchise fantasies, Doctor Strange rewards the eye rather than assaults it."
Comic Book Resources," October 28, 2016",Kristy Puchko," MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle. But sometimes, even they can't clear it."
The Sun (UK)," October 28, 2016",Jamie East," If Iron Man was Marvel's infancy and Guardians Of The Galaxy the awkward teenage years, Doctor Strange, teamed with Deadpool and Civil War, shows a company growing into adulthood with its audience. The result is an absolute joy."
Crikey," October 27, 2016",Luke Buckmaster, The screenwriters gorge on pseudo philosophical pep talk as if it were white powder at an LA pool party.
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," November 1, 2016",Aine O'Connor," Like a cross between later Harry Potter and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it might baffle younger children, but works very well on most levels."
Irish Independent," November 1, 2016",Paul Whitington," It's a lot of fun, and commendably mind-bending."
Chicago Daily Herald," November 1, 2016",Dann Gire," Humorously quirky and visually spellbinding, Doctor Strange ranks as one of the best executed Marvel Comics movies, up there with Iron Man, Spider-Man 2 and The Avengers."
News.com.au," November 1, 2016",Wenlei Ma," Doctor Strange once again proves that when it comes to superhero movies, Marvel has its finger firmly on the pulse."
Chicago Tribune," November 1, 2016",Michael Phillips," Doctor Strange really does show you a few new things, or at least familiar things in a clever new way."
NOW Toronto," November 1, 2016",Norman Wilner, Doctor Strange fulfills the requirements of a Marvel origin story while feeling wonderfully unencumbered by any of the franchise maintenance that handicapped Avengers: Age Of Ultron and Ant-Man.
People Magazine," November 1, 2016",Tom Gliatto," Any other actor in a high-collared burgundy cape and goatee would risk looking like a lounge magician. But Benedict Cumberbatch is so unmannered, so smart, so playful, he makes the title character...one of the best Marvel movie superheroes yet."
Fresno Bee," November 1, 2016",Rick Bentley," Even when the movie gets massively visual, it never gets away from the central strength of Cumberbatch's performance. That's not easy to do, but accomplishing the task is why Doctor Strange is pure Marvel magic."
Hollywood.com," November 1, 2016",Aramide Tinubu," The film is a strangely bizarre and brilliant departure from what we usually see from Marvel, and that's why I adored it."
The Movie Minute," November 1, 2016",Joanna Langfield," While very much an origins flick, this ambitious kickoff is also, happily, a movie that wows while it makes us wonder."
RedEye," November 1, 2016",Shelbie Lynn Bostedt," It is visually stunning and makes excellent use of 3D, which feels less like a gimmick and more like a vital part of experiencing the film as it's supposed to be."
Consequence of Sound," November 1, 2016",Allison Shoemaker, Doctor Strange perfectly balances its commitment to the bizarre comic book stories from which it springs with the familiar tropes of the origin story.
London Evening Standard," October 31, 2016",David Sexton," This is by far the trippiest, most psychedelic Marvel film yet."
LarsenOnFilm," October 31, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...entertains, but never haunts."
Cine Vértigo," October 31, 2016",Ernesto Diezmartinez, A film of the medical version of Tony Stark that was more enjoyable than I expected. [Full review in Spanish]
Film Journal International," October 31, 2016",Rebecca Pahle, Stunning visuals go a long way towards enlivening this largely unexceptional superhero origin story.
New York Daily News," October 31, 2016",Stephen Whitty," It's fun to have new version of an old Marvel favorite, and a storyline which adds some genuine mysticism to this ever-expanding franchise."
The Film Stage," October 31, 2016",Jordan Raup, The strangest thing about [Marvel's] latest feature is that all of these characters come across utterly bored with their vocations.
Sight and Sound," October 31, 2016",Kim Newman," Whenever the action threatens to get samey or the spectacle verges on the monotonous, the film can rely on Cumberbatch's sense of fun to tide it over."
The Mercury," October 30, 2016",Tim Martain," Doctor Strange gets in, tells its story, thrills you, makes you laugh, and then gets out before you get a chance to get sick of it. No stretching, no padding, no wasted space."
Reeling Reviews," November 2, 2016",Robin Clifford," For a non-fan just reviewing a movie, it is, as I said, noisy and entertaining."
Reeling Reviews," November 2, 2016",Laura Clifford," although ""Doctor Strange"" is often a 'been here, done that' experience, this origin story is still worthwhile because of the high pedigree of its casting and special effects."
Birth.Movies.Death.," November 2, 2016",Meredith Borders, The multi-dimensional magic of DOCTOR STRANGE's universe changes all the rules for superhero movies. It breaks from formula and leaves room for innovation and play.
Thrillist," November 2, 2016",Matt Patches," Like Strange's ""mirror-verse,"" where sorcerers cast spells...without impacting our physical realm, his comic-book vehicle delivers bursts of wonder with little lasting effect."
AV Club," November 2, 2016",A.A. Dowd," The 14th installment in the ever-expanding MCU is the first to really exploit the possibilities of CGI -- to use state-of-the-art technology to its full, jaw-dropping advantage."
Slate," November 2, 2016",Jacob Brogan," Thanks in part to its charming cast, and despite its serious intentions, Doctor Strange is a pleasantly silly film, with plenty of humor hiding amid all the reality-distorting special effects and high-flying action."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," November 2, 2016",Michael Sangiacomo," This film set the bar very high for superhero movies, something Marvel does with seeming ease."
Newsday," November 2, 2016",Rafer Guzman," Director Scott Derrickson and his co-writer, C. Robert Cargill, keep Doctor Strange balanced, just barely, between trippy psychedelia and plain incoherence."
Arizona Republic," November 2, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz," Derrickson's use of computer-generated action is a strength instead of a strain, and it's not just showing off; in the context of the film, the bizarre images make sense."
Charlotte Observer," November 2, 2016",Lawrence Toppman, You know you're in a top-drawer Marvel Comics adaptation when even the Stan Lee cameo is clever.
National Catholic Register," November 2, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus, Perhaps we might say simply that Derrickson has made a bona fide movie at a time when Marvel is only doing installments.
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," November 2, 2016",Vicky Roach," Once Doctor Strange is paired with his scene-stealing magic cape, Cumberbatch's character literally and figuratively takes flight."
Adelaide Review," November 2, 2016",David 'Mad Dog' Bradley," With one of Marvel's most indie-scene, idiosyncratic casts and co-writer/director Scott Derrickson managing to keep the wilder, trippier aspects of the plot under control (mostly), this is certainly more fun than another Iron Man adventure"
Us Weekly," November 2, 2016",Mara Reinstein," Nobody is having much fun here. Well, except for Doctor Strange's devilish Cloak of Levitation. "
RogerEbert.com," November 2, 2016",Angelica Jade Bastién," For all of its wondrous world-building and trippy effects, Doctor Strange isn't the evolutionary step forward for Marvel that it needs to be storytelling-wise."
Groucho Reviews," November 2, 2016",Peter Canavese," Doctor Strange looks at urban architecture through a twisting digital kaleidoscope, next-stepping from Inception to an M.C. Escher-esque action aesthetic that amounts to three-dimensional chess. "
Slant Magazine," November 2, 2016",Jake Cole, Nothing that Marvel Studios has produced can compare to the visual splendor of Scott Derrickson's Doctor Strange.
Metro," November 2, 2016",Matt Prigge," When ""Doctor Strange"" is cooking, which is mostly in its fairly breathless second half, it keeps throwing clever and goofy set piece ideas at you."
Punch Drunk Critics," November 2, 2016",Travis Hopson, Mashes up the metaphysical elements of Inception and The Matrix with a bit of superhero hocus-pocus.
We Live Entertainment," November 1, 2016",Fred Topel, Franchise Fred approves.
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," November 3, 2016",Bob Bloom," 'Doctor Strange' is another winning entry for Marvel. It will not disappoint fans, and those not familiar with the comic book or the character also will find the movie vastly entertaining."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," November 3, 2016",Calvin Wilson, This is as good as popcorn entertainment gets.
Collider," November 3, 2016",Matt Goldberg," Doctor Strange likes to think it's adding a new dimension to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in truth it's the same Marvel story from a slightly different perspective. "
Bullz-Eye.com," November 3, 2016",Jason Zingale," Doctor Strange never strays too far from the tried-and-true Marvel formula, but it's not afraid to get a little weird either."
The Blu Spot," November 3, 2016",Jeff Beck," No doubt there will be many who enjoy Doctor Strange simply because there's a plethora of action, but for those looking for the satisfying narrative foundation that these films are usually set upon, unfortunately you'll find it just a little lacking."
Philadelphia Inquirer," November 3, 2016",Tirdad Derakhshani," While I'm tired of the wretched tyranny of comic book flicks, I admit I liked Cumberbatch's picture. For the most part."
Parade Magazine," November 3, 2016",Neil Pond," Eyeball-popping, jaw-dropping, kaleidoscopic, head-tripping---a rollicking adventure with crisp wit, strong characters and visually impressive razzle-dazzle."
New York Times," November 3, 2016",Manohla Dargis," So visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand."
Toronto Star," November 3, 2016",Peter Howell, Cumberbatch wears that Strange cape well.
Las Vegas Weekly," November 3, 2016",Josh Bell, Entertaining and enjoyable even when it's formulaic and a bit underwhelming.

Dallas Morning News," November 2, 2016",Britton Peele, Marvel is getting increasingly good at delivering great movies based on material that shouldn't really work on film.
San Francisco Chronicle," November 2, 2016",Mick LaSalle," At least the movie takes awhile before it goes into full tilt action, and even when it does, it never completely loses itself or its central character."

Associated Press," November 2, 2016",Sandy Cohen," No affinity for superheroes or familiarity with Marvel mythology is required to enjoy the visual spectacle that is Doctor Strange. Being open to mysticism and the possibility of parallel dimensions might help, though."
Tribune News Service," November 2, 2016",Katie Walsh," Watching ""Doctor Strange"" is a bit like ordering pad thai at Applebee's: It's different than the usual, but still kind of bland."
MTV," November 2, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Defiantly old-school -- not the cozy, apple-scented nostalgia of the first Captain America film, but that cold, back-of-the-library whiff of eraser nubs and mold. "
NPR," November 3, 2016",Scott Tobias," Even with the fate of the entire universe at stake, Derrickson keeps the tone appealingly light and jokey, and Cumberbatch's Strange isn't so cynical that he can't thrill at discovering his spectacular capabilities ..."
Blu-ray.com," November 3, 2016",Brian Orndorf," It's a mostly successful and visually dazzling introduction for the wizard, who fits in comfortably with the ongoing brand name world-building, making him a welcomingly oddball avenger. "

San Diego Reader," November 3, 2016",Matthew Lickona," As a Christian allegory, director Scott Derrickson's entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe is impressively thorough...As a movie, it's silly, sloppy, and spectacular."
ReelViews," November 3, 2016",James Berardinelli, Doctor Strange tells a standard tale with just enough cleverness to keep the viewer interested.
Boston Globe," November 3, 2016",Tom Russo," The mystical settings that this ""sorcerer supreme"" navigates make for exhilarating sensory overload, powerfully expanding on classic visuals from pioneering Marvel artist Steve Ditko. The upshot: The movie develops a distinctively trippy identity."
Kansas City Star," November 3, 2016",Jon Niccum, Cumberbatch grounds the material even while levitating.
One Guy's Opinion," November 3, 2016",Frank Swietek," Not strange enough; it has plenty of CGI magic effects, but lacks the cinematic magic that would set it apart from the other franchises in Marvel's increasingly crowded stable."

Hindustan Times," November 4, 2016",Rohan Naahar," If only the same care that has gone into its visuals were put in the rest of it, Doctor Strange could've been a trippy, psychedelic adventure, and not a middling entry in a 14-film-old franchise."
NYC Movie Guru," November 3, 2016",Avi Offer," Well-cast with dazzling visuals and production design, but somewhat dull, and it lacks enough surprises and wit to escape its mediocrity. It's lucky to have Benedict Cumberbatch who rises above the material with his charisma."

Rolling Stone," November 3, 2016",Peter Travers," See it in 3-D IMAX, people, and you're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year. And having Cumberbatch around really raises the bar on what's possible in comic-book fantasy."
New England Movies Weekly," November 3, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," Through outstanding casting, splashy visuals, and some unexpected (and welcome) wit, [this] is easily the best of comic book movie of the year."
New York Magazine/Vulture," November 3, 2016",David Edelstein," Doctor Strange has a dazzling, kaleidoscopic palette that compensates for the usual thin-ish story featuring A-list actors zapping one another, along with a hero who looks fearsomely witty even in repose."
Black Girl Nerds," November 3, 2016",Joelle Smith," For a film that has promised diversity and wanting to move from harmful Asian stereotypes, this movie fails to bring in people of color in a meaningful way. "
Austin American-Statesman," November 3, 2016",Joe Gross," Doctor Strange is a solidly enjoyable superhero romp, one with the zippiest effects you are going to see this year. I just wish it was a little... stranger."

Wall Street Journal," November 3, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, For a long while Doctor Strange works both sides of the spiritual street with spectacular success. Then the film becomes what it was sending up so delightfully.

Brooklyn Magazine," November 4, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," Basically Iron Man with weaker laugh lines and vastly cooler action sequences. It's Iron Man meets Thor 2, and the thing is, those guys have met before."
Las Vegas Review-Journal," November 4, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," Even as it closely adheres to the Marvel origin story template, it's the studio's most out-there release yet -- and that's saying something after Guardians of the Galaxy."
Tolucan Times," November 4, 2016",Tony Medley," ...the best 3-D I have ever seen...so good that I actually got dizzy . It's the special effects and 3-D that make this entertaining, certainly not the fantasy or the hackneyed story or anything else."
The New Republic," November 4, 2016",Will Leitch," Doctor Strange is about as weird as any Marvel movie is going to get these days, which is not particularly weird. "
Vox," November 4, 2016",Alex Abad-Santos," Even though the film is Marvel's crowning aesthetic triumph, even though all four of its stars have their game faces on and act their hearts out, even though it's got great humor and spirit, Doctor Strange isn't close to being Marvel's best movie."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," November 4, 2016",Josh Terry," Even if the story behind the curtain can't quite equal the visual spectacle, Doctor Strange will put a smile on the faces of casual and hardcore fans alike."
Cambridge Day," November 4, 2016",Tom Meek," It's not as fresh and sassy as Guardians of the Galaxy, but it is a piquant changeup for fans who have come to find the Avengers series getting long in the tooth."
Toledo Blade," November 4, 2016",Kirk Baird," A mind-bending, exciting, funny, and, yes, strange adventure, that ranks among Marvel's best, and as a superhero introduction film is second to only 2008's Iron Man."
Christian Science Monitor," November 4, 2016",Peter Rainer," The Marvel Comics movie universe gets a bit bigger, though not appreciably better, with Doctor Strange."
Suburban Journals of St. Louis," November 4, 2016",Mathew DeKinder," 'Doctor Strange' is a lot of fun, but it's also unquestionably the most eyeball-popping comic book movie to come along, even being worthy of paying for the 3D upgrade."
HollywoodInToto.com," November 4, 2016",Christian Toto," Can the ""wizards"" behind those DC Comics movies please take notes while watching Doctor Strange?"
Examiner.com," November 4, 2016",Chris Sawin," Visually, this is a hallucinatory wet dream. However, like the character in the film, Doctor Strange offers a spellbinding exploration of what lies beyond the stars yet lacks the proper mastery of the mystical concepts it introduces. "

Kaplan vs. Kaplan," November 6, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," Yes, we've seen remarkable special effects in the past, but the visual effects provided by Industrial Light & Magic and Luma Pictures are, well, magical. "

ABC Radio Brisbane," November 6, 2016",Matthew Toomey," Providing a finale that doesn't rely on explosions and drawn-out punch ups, Doctor Strange earns points for being a little different."
Creative Loafing," November 5, 2016",Matt Brunson," Rote storytelling and pesky politics aside, the film does offer its rewards, particularly in Cumberbatch's fine performance, some twisty visuals (many cribbed from Inception), and the occasional dabs of gentle humor."
Boston Herald," November 5, 2016",James Verniere," Dull, talky, derivative, full of the usual CGI cheez whiz. Cumberbatch is the epitome of vanilla."
Flavorwire," November 5, 2016",Jason Bailey," If it's not great storytelling, at least it's good spectacle, and that seems like the minimum these movies can provide."

Starburst," November 4, 2016",Jack Bottomley," Rest easy fans, Marvel have delivered... again."
Independent Online (South Africa)," November 4, 2016",Theresa Smith," It is an entertaining action movie that features a confident lead who takes the role seriously, so you take the story about magic seriously."
Film Comment Magazine," November 4, 2016",Jonathan Romney, Doctor Strange seems to represent the point at which the art of CGI and the discipline of imagining visual images spatially seems to have reached a sublime degree of 3D complexity.

Killer Movie Reviews," November 4, 2016",Andrea Chase," From a whiz-bang opening sequence where space folds in on itself as combatants hurl magical fire at on another, to the charismatic, ahem, marvel that is Benedict Cumberbatch in the title role, this action film is a knockout."

Vanguardia (Mexico)," November 10, 2016",Carlos Díaz Reyes, An interesting story with excellent characters and special effects that will make me say a phrase that is already very worn (but true): they do not resemble anything I've seen in this type of movies before. [Full review in Spanish]

Sacramento News & Review," November 10, 2016",Jim Lane," Much of it takes place in the ""Mirror Dimension,"" an eye-popping universe that M.C. Escher might have imagined if he'd worked with CGI. That, plus a strong story and stronger cast makes this a winner."

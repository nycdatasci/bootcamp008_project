Laramie Movie Scope," January 19, 2017",Robert Roten," This film seems funny enough and exciting enough to entertain kids, but there really isn't much constructive in the story itself, which is pretty close to nonsensical."
Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",Ellen Murray," Bright, fun and moving, this film is a solid, though not exactly ground-breaking, addition to the Pixar line-up."
Total Film," January 1, 2017",Neil Smith," For all its attempts to expand the original's ensemble and embellish its themes, Dory is cod in batter beside Nemo's smoked salmon. But still tasty."
Seven Days," January 1, 2017",Margot Harrison," The aquatic world of Dory doesn't teem with as many fascinating details as the mammalian world of spring's Zootopia, but it has its share of clever visual gags, many of them occasioned by Hank's camouflaging abilities. "
Hindustan Times," December 31, 2016",Rashid Irani," This fishy tale may not be as lively as its popular predecessor. Still, Finding Dory strikes gold anew for a new generation of family filmgoers."
MetroActive," December 31, 2016",Richard von Busack," What makes Pixar great is the way it always casts shadows behind its polychrome colors, contrasting a child's conflicted urges for safety and adventure."
NUVO Newsweekly," December 31, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott," In general, Finding Dory doesn't reach the heights of the original, but it delivers an hour and 40 minutes of solid entertainment."
Daily Star," December 31, 2016",Andy Lea," Stanton takes aim at the heart instead of the head. This is another touching fable about friendship, self-reliance and courage."
Columbus Alive," December 30, 2016",Brad Keefe," This sequel is certainly more than just a shameless cash-in on one of Pixar's finest films, but it's also not quite up to the studio's highest standards."
"Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)"," December 26, 2016",John Beifuss," A reversal of 'Finding Nemo' that -- like its predecessor -- revels in the imaginative opportunities afforded by its floaty, almost surreal underwater environment, the movie has charm and warmth but lacks distinction."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri, Kids around six and eight will likely love the offerings here but adults might find their patience tested by this brilliantly rendered but rather wet serving of Disney franchise extender. 
Sunday Times (UK)," December 18, 2016",Camilla Long, A cute follow-up to Finding Nemo.
MovieCrypt.com," December 13, 2016",Kevin A. Ranson, ...look closer. Even Pixar's sages seem a bit bored with their normal M.O. ...but only Sigourney Weaver knows for sure.
Antagony & Ecstasy," December 4, 2016",Tim Brayton," The best sequel made by Pixar Animation Studios without the word ""toy"" in the title. This is a relief, but not all that much of an achievement."
Seanax.com," November 18, 2016",Sean Axmaker, ... a Pixar picture with all the care and love and storytelling magic that the studio brings to every project. Which makes this adventure a joyous reunion and a lovely odyssey.
Movie Mezzanine," November 17, 2016",Josh Spiegel," Finding Dory is a good movie, meaning that Pixar has a batting average of four for five when it comes to sequels. "
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Piers Marchant," It's not bad -- certainly, the worst Pixar films are still eminently watchable -- but nor is it particularly inspired."
The Blu Spot," November 14, 2016",Jeff Beck," Finding Dory may not quite reach the narrative success of its predecessor, but with an outstanding vocal cast, gorgeous animation, and plenty of heart, it still stands as a fine addition to Pixar's outstanding library of animated classics."
Cinemanía (Spain)," October 4, 2016",David Bernal," Its originality radicates in its execution: frantic rhythm, a detailed script, brilliant design, and emotional hits strategically placed with a bunch of new characters. [Full review in Spanish]"
"Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Canada)"," September 30, 2016",Brian Gibson," Two raffish sea lions, a loony bird, and camouflaging, ink-blurting Gary are welcome new additions. But there's no thematic reason to return to Nemo-land-the messages are predictable. Sprightly and amusing but a bit slight and not quite memorable enough."
USA Today," June 10, 2016",Brian Truitt," While the animation is still top-notch and a slew of new waterlogged personalities buoy the story, it doesn't have nearly the same sense of heart, wonder and awe as Nemo."
Entertainment Weekly," June 10, 2016",Chris Nashawaty, One of the biggest and most pleasant surprises in a film with too few of them is just how resonant Dory will be for parents of kids with learning disabilities.
TheWrap," June 10, 2016",Alonso Duralde," Stanton and co-director Angus MacLane augment the hilarious characters with visual grandeur (who knew there were this many shades of blue?) and comedy, particularly from Hank the octopus' chameleonic and contortionist skills."
ScreenCrush," June 10, 2016",Matt Singer," After 21 years, the Pixar formula is still very satisfying. But it also feels more like a formula than ever before."
Hollywood Reporter," June 10, 2016",Todd McCarthy," Its heroine may suffer from short-term memory loss, but viewers with any memory at all will realize that Finding Dory falls rather short of its wondrous progenitor."
Variety," June 10, 2016",Owen Gleiberman," Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane, the co-directors of ""Finding Dory,"" have made a beautiful, rambunctious, and fully felt sequel - a movie totally worth its salt water."
Uproxx," June 10, 2016",Mike Ryan, Finding Dory is just about as good as Finding Nemo and will probably make you cry. 
indieWire," June 10, 2016",David Ehrlich," Pixar's best film since Up, and a compelling argument as to why we make sequels in the first place. "
Student Edge," June 14, 2016",Simon Miraudo," Pixar's latest is yet another sequel that's head and fin above most animated fare, but not accomplishing much more than the original already managed. (See also: Monsters University. Don't see, ever: Cars 2.)"
We Got This Covered," June 14, 2016",Matt Donato," Finding Dory does something special - and courageous - with the message it tells, offering children something much more than entertainment."
Comic Book Resources," June 14, 2016",Kristy Puchko," Finding Dory will likely mean the world to those living with special needs, or those who love them. Pixar has given them a hero who is special and needed."
Urban Cinefile," June 14, 2016",Louise Keller," It's bright and colourful with a throng of ultra cute marine characters but the film is a pale imitation of its precursor Finding Nemo, never replicating its magic or touching our heartstrings."
The Film Stage," June 14, 2016",Brian Roan," In terms of emotional complexity and character evolution, Finding Dory treads the same water as its predecessor with less success. "
Groucho Reviews," June 14, 2016",Peter Canavese," If the plotting at first feels overly familiar (and, in many ways, is), its elegance becomes apparent in the reinvigorating final movements, which also confirm Finding Dory's ultimate theme of building self-confidence through self-discovery."
Village Voice," June 14, 2016",Bilge Ebiri, Finding Dory is one of the most devastating things Pixar has made - all while often being even bouncier than Finding Nemo.
Guardian," June 14, 2016",Jordan Hoffman," DeGeneres's vocal performance is extraordinary, effortlessly shifting from jokes to self-perpetuated anxiety attacks."
Nerd Report," June 13, 2016",Fred Topel, A compassionate portrait of mental illness for families with young ones... It's also got a Die Hard 2 thing going on.
BuzzFeed News," June 13, 2016",Alison Willmore," Dory is still irrepressible in Finding Dory, still making her way brightly and cluelessly through life in a state of perpetual now, but her backstory adds a steady element of pathos to a movie that otherwise follows in the same beats as the original."
Metro," June 13, 2016",Matt Prigge," Never as shattering as Pixar's best and most brutal. In fact, it's almost subtle. But it's the kind of film that dares you to undermine it, just so it can whack you upside the head and steal one more tear."
RogerEbert.com," June 13, 2016",Susan Wloszczyna," The result might be less fulfilling this time, but ""Dory"" is ultimately worth the voyage."
Examiner.com," June 11, 2016",Travis Hopson," One of the great joys of ""Finding Dory"" is that every character you loved will be just as dear to your heart as before. "
Sensacine," June 11, 2016",Alejandro G. Calvo, A fantasy trip that will make you leave the theatre smiling. [Full review in Spanish]
New York Daily News," June 10, 2016",Ethan Sacks," There will be enough tears to fill a small inflatable pool, if not an ocean."
Screen International," June 10, 2016",Tim Grierson," Although never challenging the original's high standing within the Pixar pantheon, this sequel showcases everything the venerated animation company does so well, providing plentiful laughs, ace action sequences and a deep emotional wellspring."
CinemaBlend.com," June 10, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," On a scale of Cars 2 to Toy Story 3, Finding Dory is about on par with Monsters University - delivering more of characters that audiences love, while not quite reaching the level of its predecessor."
TheFilmFile.com," June 10, 2016",Dustin Putman," Unequivocal joy in cinematic form. There is a reason the delightful ""Finding Nemo"" has become a beloved modern animated classic, and ""Finding Dory"" is headed for the same heralded status."
Forbes," June 10, 2016",Scott Mendelson, It's neither as good as you hoped nor as bad as you feared. 
Time Out," June 10, 2016",Anna King," Pixar's wizardry is baked into every detail, from the sun-dappled ocean surfaces to the underwater visuals that border on photorealism. It's unforgettable stuff."
The Straits Times (Singapore)," June 15, 2016",John Lui," Finding Dory is a solid piece of all-ages entertainment, but in depth of emotion, it does not reach the standard set by predecessor Finding Nemo."
Us Weekly," June 15, 2016",Mara Reinstein," Sometimes it takes a plucky animated fish to illustrate the benefits of thinking on your fins (er, feet). Now that's a lesson worth retaining. "
ComingSoon.net," June 15, 2016",Scott Chitwood," Finding Dory has some excellent animation, impressive 3D effects, and fun new characters."
FILMINK (Australia)," June 15, 2016",Erin Free," ...smart, funny, and visually astounding..."
Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com," June 15, 2016",Maricar Estrella," Another huge improvement from its predecessor is the animation, from the way the kelp sways in the ocean to Hank's camouflaging metamorphosis. The filmmakers provide a dynamic, colorful backdrop worthy of 3-D viewing."
MTV," June 15, 2016",Amy Nicholson, Morbidity covers every scale of Finding Dory like fin rot.
Herald Sun (Australia)," June 15, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," Though a clear notch beneath its classic predecessor Finding Nemo, lively pacing and a genuinely inspired finale is sure to leave viewers of all ages perfectly happy with what they have seen."
Consequence of Sound," June 15, 2016",Allison Shoemaker," Finding Dory is like meeting up with an old friend and realizing that somehow, in spite of all the years and distance, no time has passed at all."
PopMatters," June 15, 2016",Chris Barsanti," ...at least exceeds expectations, if not the original."
HeyUGuys," June 15, 2016",Cassam Looch," Another fine film from Pixar, not a classic but fans of Finding Nemo will be very happy Dory just kept swimming."
Rolling Stone," June 15, 2016",Peter Travers," If Finding Dory lacks the fresh surprise of its predecessor, it still brims with humor, heart and animation miracles. "
Newark Star-Ledger," June 15, 2016",Stephen Whitty," There's a new Pixar film in theaters, and it's a catch."

Chicago Tribune," June 15, 2016",Michael Phillips," The visual personality of the movie is fantastically vivid and bright, the story itself, less so."
San Francisco Chronicle," June 15, 2016",Peter Hartlaub," It rises above its crowded narrative with an intense emotional core, taking a protagonist whose affliction had been played mostly for comedy, and exploring the emptiness and loneliness of her plight."
AV Club," June 15, 2016",A.A. Dowd," Finding Dory, like most ""lesser Pixar,"" is more fun around the edges than the competition tends to be at center."
Newsday," June 14, 2016",Rafer Guzman," ""Finding Dory"" upholds the Pixar tradition with plenty of inventive humor, cleverly drawn characters and emotionally resonant moments."
San Jose Mercury News," June 14, 2016",Tony Hicks," Of course, ""Dory"" has plot similarities to ""Nemo,"" but there is enough love and care devoted to everything from the characters on down that it works beautifully, even without element of surprise."
Lyles' Movie Files," June 14, 2016",Jeffrey Lyles," Finding Dory is the kind of enthralling, immersive movie that will have your inner Inside Out crew working overtime handling all the emotions."
Las Vegas Weekly," June 16, 2016",Josh Bell," While Dory is thoroughly charming and enjoyable, it's also a bit formulaic and repetitive, especially during the drawn-out third act."
The Playlist," June 15, 2016",Jamie Maleszka," A worthy successor, Finding Dory sets its own course, and joyfully delivers."
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," June 15, 2016",Vicky Roach," Finding Dory has some great new characters -- Ed O'Neill's cantankerous Octopus, Ty Burrell's beluga whale and Kaitlin Olson's whale shark stand out. The animation is exquisite. A good portion of the film, however, feels reheated."
Minneapolis Star Tribune," June 15, 2016",Colin Covert," There's a big undersea world out there in Finding Dory, one that's endlessly diverse and consistently beautiful. Not only in its dazzling photorealist images, but in the story's creative depth."
RedEye," June 15, 2016",Sara Amato," There's a sense of familiarity with Finding Dory. It's not breaking new ground. But it also doesn't have to. Pixar has perfected the formula, and if it's not broken, there's no point in trying to fix it. It just works."
Associated Press," June 15, 2016",Jake Coyle," Finding Dory, bright and clever like most all Pixar releases, has the animation studio's familiar blend of wit, heart and visual detail. But it's missing its own magic."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," June 15, 2016",Laura DeMarco," It's a lovely trip, with the swirling sea and rainbow-hued sea creatures as gorgeously animated as you would expect from Pixar."
Slate," June 15, 2016",Dana Stevens," Finding Dory often goes, if you'll forgive the maritime metaphor, to a level a few fathoms below the cruising depth of its much-loved predecessor."

Slant Magazine," June 15, 2016",Christopher Gray, Finding Dory follows its predecessor in being broadly concerned with comforting notions of home and family.
New York Times," June 15, 2016",A.O. Scott," The inclusiveness of the film's vision is remarkable partly because it feels so natural, something that no adult will really need to explain. Children will get it, perhaps more intuitively and easily than the rest of us."
Film Journal International," June 15, 2016",Daniel Eagan," In Finding Dory, [director Andrew] Stanton and his crew strike a perfect balance between art and entertainment."
Tampa Bay Times," June 15, 2016",Steve Persall," Finding Dory can't be faulted for much except it isn't Finding Nemo. No shame in that, just sadness. Thirteen years ago a movie broke ground now stomped flat by an animation stampede... Greatness deserves better. How soon we forget."
Miami Herald," June 15, 2016",Rene Rodriguez," Finding Dory isn't so much a sequel to Finding Nemo as it is a Looney Tunes spin-off: Wilder, sillier, broader and instantly disposable. "
MovieWeb," June 15, 2016",Julian Roman, Finding Dory is an incredibly imaginative sequel with just the right amount of humor and heart.

The National (UAE)," June 15, 2016",Chris Newbould, Finding Dory is the first major film we can remember getting a release during Ramadan. Time will tell whether this gamble works -- but this is exactly the kind of movie that families would want to make a point of going to see.
St. Paul Pioneer Press," June 16, 2016",Chris Hewitt (St. Paul)," The title character may be a forgetful fish, but ""Finding Dory"" is a movie to remember."
St. Louis Post-Dispatch," June 16, 2016",Calvin Wilson," Audiences should find ""Dory"" one of Pixar's most charming achievements."
Chicago Daily Herald," June 16, 2016",Dann Gire," [It} lacks the wit, imagination and sheer sense of amazement that made the 2003 original an eventual animation classic. Nonetheless, Dory offers adventure and fun as it swims in gorgeous, animated, photorealistic detail."
Austin Chronicle," June 16, 2016",Kimberley Jones," Where Finding Nemo capitalized on the awesome splendor and danger of the ocean, this follow-up shifts much of its action to an aquatic park and becomes broader and sillier, or at least reality-busting, for it. And, hey, that's OK."
San Diego Reader," June 16, 2016",Matthew Lickona, Directors Andrew Stanton and Angus MacLane make it very clear what you are supposed to feel and when you are supposed to feel it. What they don't do is earn it.

Blu-ray.com," June 16, 2016",Brian Orndorf," A perfectly serviceable continuation that doesn't truly widen the oceanic realm, but it does make time for old friends and familiar conflicts, playing it safe to make sure the faithful walk away satisfied. "
Bullz-Eye.com," June 16, 2016",David Medsker," For the most part, the film plays it maddeningly safe, and then the third act arrives, at which point all hell breaks loose in the most glorious, adorable way possible."
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," June 16, 2016",Jeanne Kaplan," ""Finding Dory"" will have a strong place in the summer animation line-up, but may get lost in the Oscar shuffle. "
Kaplan vs. Kaplan," June 16, 2016",David Kaplan," With genius executive producer John Lasseter's stamp of approval on ""Finding Dory"", what's not to like?"
One Guy's Opinion," June 16, 2016",Frank Swietek, It's ironic that a movie about a character with short-term memory loss turns out to be one of Pixar's more forgettable efforts...[still it] will afford modest pleasure to children and adults alike.
SSG Syndicate," June 16, 2016",Susan Granger," Emotionally engaging, it's splashy family fun..."
Reeling Reviews," June 16, 2016",Laura Clifford," Hank [the octopus] is one of the best characters Pixar's ever brought to life, aided by O'Neill's grumpy-with-a-heart vocalization. 'Holy carp!' indeed."
Empire Magazine," June 16, 2016",Jimi Famurewa, Pixar sequel-phobes be damned - this is a dazzling and technically impressive return to form that delivers a similar high to Finding Nemo without feeling like a retread.
Charlotte Observer," June 16, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," The movie has plenty of heart and a message which, if not always subtle, remains worth hearing: All of us have strengths and weaknesses, while qualities that disable us in one way might enable us in another."
Dallas Morning News," June 16, 2016",Nancy Churnin," Resisting the temptation to rehash Finding Nemo with new characters as too many sequels do, this fine-finned tale tells a complementary story from the opposite direction."
Kansas City Star," June 16, 2016",Jon Niccum," ""Finding Dory"" ranks with ""Toy Story 3"" as the animation studio's strongest sequel. The underwater tale manages to be both immersive and buoyant."
TIME Magazine," June 16, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Although DeGeneres' Dory, with her breathless stream-of-consciousness patter, is unavoidably likable, the cast of supporting characters here may be even better."
Brooklyn Magazine," June 16, 2016",Jesse Hassenger," If the first movie was about parents learning to face their fears and trust their children, this one is about facing the fears that come with parenting a special-needs child."
Seattle Times," June 16, 2016",Moira MacDonald," For all the witty voices and great escapes (maybe one too many of the latter), ""Finding Dory"" is ultimately a character story, and DeGeneres' lovable, brave Dory swims right into our hearts."
IGN Movies," June 16, 2016",Max Nicholson," Did Finding Nemo really need a sequel? Probably not. But Finding Dory deftly manages to breathe new life into Pixar's most popular fish, while also introducing a school of lively new newcomers as well."
Wall Street Journal," June 16, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," ""Finding Dory"" can be touching, sweet and tender, but it's compulsively, preposterously and steadfastly funny."
Boston Globe," June 16, 2016",Mark Feeney," There are terrific Pixar sequels (""Toy Story 2"" and ""3"") and OK Pixar sequels (""Cars 2,"" ""Monsters University""). ""Finding Dory"" is one of the terrific ones, if not quite up to the ""Toy Story"" standard."

Houston Community Newspapers," June 16, 2016",Danny Minton, Finding Dory will be a popular summer movie but just don't expect one of their better performances.
Chicago Reader," June 16, 2016",J. R. Jones," The elemental emotions at work and the childlike awe at the undersea world -- rendered once again in colorful, carefully researched, lovingly precise animation -- contribute to the sense of a story timeless and pure. "
honeycuttshollywood.com," June 16, 2016",Kirk Honeycutt," A world-wide aquatic playground filled with rambunctious slapstick, Dickensian sea creatures, astonishing visual beauty and relentless albeit implausible jeopardy."
People Magazine," June 16, 2016",Tom Gliatto," The marvel of Dory, and of so many Pixar movies, is that the primal payload is securely delivered even as the plot gets crowded with vivid, scene-stealing characters and takes wildly inventive twists."
"Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)"," June 16, 2016",Bob Bloom," 'Dory' ... works on multiple levels: It's a fun-filled animated feature that will please and entertain children and ... parents, while it also examines how parents protect, encourage and love offspring with special needs. ... "
Vox," June 16, 2016",Caroline Framke," Finding Dory [is] a powerful story of loss and, eventually, improbable triumph."
BBC.com," June 16, 2016",Sam Adams," We cry not because the movie has tapped into our deepest hopes and fears, but because this is the part where we're supposed to. Dory's catchphrase is ""Just keep swimming,"" but the movie feels like it's just paddling in circles."
Philadelphia Inquirer," June 16, 2016",Steven Rea," Much of Finding Dory is funny, and fun. But there's something kind of haunting about our heroine's memory thing."
Toronto Sun," June 16, 2016",Bruce Kirkland," Finding Dory is delightful throughout, dazzling during its many highlight scenes and just a tad disorienting on rare occasions."
National Post," June 16, 2016",Chris Knight," Kids should enjoy the frantic pace of the movie, but adult fans of Nemo (AFONs?) may grumble about diminishing returns."
The Verge," June 16, 2016",Tasha Robinson," Finding Dory isn't a vital addition to the Pixar canon... But it's nice to see Stanton back in his element, especially when he's here to deliver such a helpful, important message in the process."
CineXpress," June 16, 2016",Fico Cangiano, Easily the best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3. [Full review in Spanish]
Washington Post," June 16, 2016",Ann Hornaday," In deciding not to stray far from the first film in plot or tone, it makes for a pleasant, familiar, cheerfully unassuming fish-in-her-water tale."
Globe and Mail," June 17, 2016",Kate Taylor," A sequel that betters the boffo 2003 animated feature Finding Nemo and provides more evidence, after last year's highly original Inside Out, that Pixar has finally emerged from the uninspiring years of the Cars franchise."
Detroit News," June 17, 2016",Patrick Dunn," The film is often visually striking and charming enough, but it's low on two things we've come to expect from Pixar: comedy and moving emotional moments."
NYC Movie Guru," June 16, 2016",Avi Offer," Funny, genuinely poignant, and thrilling with dazzling CGI. It will win your heart over. Expect it to be nominated for Best Animated Feature. "

Christianity Today," June 16, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," [Finding Dory] is flat-out terrific, even a little subversive."

Chicago Sun-Times," June 16, 2016",Richard Roeper," It's a solid, entertaining, well-paced sequel featuring terrific voice work, a clever script and some ingenious action sequences."
Austin American-Statesman," June 16, 2016",Joe Gross, It is a perfectly entertaining film; kids will certainly enjoy it. But that's all it is.
Fort Worth Weekly," June 16, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," Much of the movie is genuinely entertaining, but some of it betrays the same desperation that you find in bad animated flicks, as the filmmakers keep things loud, fast, and colorful in the hope that the smallest audience members won't get bored."
America Magazine," June 16, 2016",John Anderson," Any fan of Pixar already knows what they are going to get at Finding Dory: a mix of charm, wit and intelligence, combined with animation so routinely spectacular that a reviewer might not even think to mention it until the end of his review."
Toronto Star," June 16, 2016",Peter Howell," Finding Dory may be more of a minnow than a whale of a tale for Pixar, but it's still a good catch."
Times (UK)," June 16, 2016",Kate Muir," The ""fish out of water"" theme plays out to Buster Keaton-style excess in the hilarious and adorable Finding Dory."
Screen It!," June 16, 2016",Jim Judy," While it might not quite match up to the overall beginning to end brilliance of ""Nemo,"" ""Dory"" is a well-made, entertaining and certainly enjoyable film for viewers of all ages. (Full Content Review for Parents - Scares, etc. - Also Available)"
Las Vegas Review-Journal," June 16, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," Structurally, it's pretty similar to Finding Nemo, and plenty of familiar characters turn up. But the animation strides made in the 13 years between movies are remarkable. Finding Dory looks spectacular."
Los Angeles Times," June 16, 2016",Kenneth Turan," As the 13-year gap between ""Nemo"" and ""Dory"" indicates, this was not a concept that cried out to be made."
NPR," June 16, 2016",Andrew Lapin," It is nice, especially at this precise moment, to believe that evil and cruelty don't necessarily have to exist in the world: that even in the great big ocean, a couple of small fish looking for help can always depend on the kindness of strangers."
Dork Shelf," June 16, 2016",Jason Gorber," Full on action farce that had me trademark Fast and the Fishiest as a new title for the flick, [yet] with PIXAR's latest outing it seems that they're treading water"
EricDSnider.com," June 17, 2016",Eric D. Snider," It's all lovely and sweet, gentle and humane, but it doesn't rise to the creative or emotional heights of its predecessor."
Independent Online (South Africa)," June 17, 2016",Latoya Newman," Loaded with excitement and adrenalin- packed moments, Finding Dory is, as expected, full of humour, largely due to Dory's memory issues and delightfully funny nature."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," June 17, 2016",Josh Terry, It's a quality piece of family animation with a fun finish that hits a few themes you might expect and a few that will surprise you.
The New Republic," June 17, 2016",Will Leitch," It's a sequel that's a continuation of the original film rather than an expansion of it, and it is still a success, though not a triumph."
Bangkok Post," June 17, 2016",Melalin Mahavongtrakul," Despite its minor flaws, Finding Dory is still successful at serving a good platter of both humour and nostalgia."
Playboy Online," June 17, 2016",Stephen Rebello," Finding Dory is charming, very funny, touching and more than a bit repetitive but never a bore."
Tulsa World," June 17, 2016",Michael Smith," The gorgeous, thoughtful, funny Finding Dory is made by the Pixar family for everyone to share with someone they care about, no matter the age, gender, ethnicity -- or even species, for that matter."
Film Comment Magazine," June 17, 2016",Michael Sragow, Stanton is a born comic-fantasy director.
Toledo Blade," June 17, 2016",Kirk Baird," Just when it appears Finding Dory is the latest in a long line of sequel casualties, the deliriously fun and witty third act arrives to mount a revival, as everything comes together and the setups finally deliver laugh-out-loud payoffs."
Tri-City Herald," June 17, 2016",Gary Wolcott, Kudos to Ellen. It's an Oscar-worthy performance. Finding Dory is so well-done and beautifully filmed that you forget the main characters aren't real fish and other sea life. 
Common Sense Media," June 17, 2016",Sandie Angulo Chen, Delightful sequel promotes teamwork; some sadness/scares.
Parade Magazine," June 17, 2016",Neil Pond," There may be tears. But remember what Dory says: Just keep swimming, just keep swimming. "
AARP Movies for Grownups," June 17, 2016",Bill Newcott," DeGeneres has the funny bits down pat...But it's in Dory's quieter moments that (she) breathes a soul into her little blue character: Speaking barely above a whisper, she registers wonder, trepidation and, occasionally, heartbreaking sorrow."
The List," June 17, 2016",Yasmin Sulaiman," While it's too similar to the Oscar-winning original to swim completely solo, Finding Dory is a delightful sequel that gives further life to some of Pixar's most loveable characters."
"Capital Times (Madison, WI)"," June 17, 2016",Rob Thomas," The closing credits feature Sia singing Nat King Cole's ""Unforgettable"" - it's a good gag, but I wouldn't go quite that far in describing ""Finding Dory.""

National Catholic Register," June 17, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus," Hank the octopus is a particular standout … his mad skills are highly entertaining — so entertaining, in fact, that I kind of wish the movie had been about him."
The Sunday Age," June 19, 2016",Craig Mathieson," Dory can fritter away your interest, and the prominence also exposes the limitations of DeGeneres as a voice actor: daffy blather is a cinch for the talk-show host, but she absolutely milks any attempt at pathos."
The Standard," June 19, 2016",Matt Neal," Like all Pixar movies (except Cars 2), this has some golden moments that hit you right in the feels."
New England Movies Weekly," June 19, 2016",Daniel M. Kimmel," ...a solid effort and a nice comeback from last year's The Good Dinosaur, but this is not the best American animated feature we've seen this year."
The Patriot Ledger," June 18, 2016",Al Alexander," For a fish story, ""Finding Dory"" is pretty small scale. Or at least it seems when tossed into the sea with a whopper like ""Finding Nemo."" It simply can't measure up emotionally or narratively. "
CineVue," June 18, 2016",Matthew Anderson," Finding Dory is as entertaining, soul enriching and bittersweet as any Pixar production to date."
Creative Loafing," June 18, 2016",Matt Brunson," Efforts like Finding Dory, while perfectly pleasant, do little to quell the feeling that a certain measure of rubber-stamp efficiency has gripped the studio (the superb Inside Out excepted). In other words, welcome to Pixar's cash-grab years."
Maven's Nest," June 17, 2016",Nora Lee Mandel, Gently entertaining... gets funny...Tidbits provide something for adults when they take the kids but that is not enough of a reason for adults to come on their own.
Cinemalogue.com," June 17, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, This follow-up provides a solid mix of action and comedy without allowing its melancholy themes to channel cheap sentiment.
The Australian," June 17, 2016",David Stratton," Dory's adventures are amiable enough, but the film lacks energy and suffers from a sense of predictability."
Sci-Fi Movie Page," June 17, 2016",Rob Vaux," It took them thirteen years to find the right way to tell her story, but all that time and effort has produced quite a gem."
L.A. Biz," June 17, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," The franchise from the outset has confronted notions of disability and challenged parental responses to it, and Finding Dory is no different."

"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," June 17, 2016",Robert Horton, Finding Dory could be funnier. It relies on some callbacks to Finding Nemo and a lot of over-the-top action. But you'd have to have a briny heart to deny there's something special about it.
Spliced Personality," June 17, 2016",Sean Burns," Perhaps it's because I'm a soulless husk of a man and dead inside, but the Pixar formula just isn't cutting it for me anymore."
Reel Reviews," June 17, 2016",Frank Wilkins," Though it lacks the same emotional heft of the original, it's darned near good enough to change one's unfavorable opinion of sequels"

Paste Magazine," June 17, 2016",Michael Snydel," What the film lacks in clean-cut storytelling, though, it more than makes up for in sheer emotionality. Finding Dory is the rare sequel that repurposes the original as a foundation rather than as a cheap form of fan service."
ScreenRant," June 17, 2016",Ben Kendrick," Finding Dory isn't just a worthy sequel to Nemo, it also succeeds on its own - as a rousing tale of love and overcoming adversity."
Christian Science Monitor," June 17, 2016",Peter Rainer, There are some rollicky moments in Finding Dory... [But] the inventiveness of the animation is not matched by the frayed workmanship of the story line.

International Business Times," July 13, 2016",Amy West," It may not be the freshest story in the Pixar catalogue to date but with its undeniable feel-good nature and authentic nods of nostalgia, you'll certainly find yourself smiling from ear-to-ear that these lovable little fish have swum back into your lives."
Digital Spy," July 11, 2016",Paul F Cockburn, It's filled to the gills with engaging anthropomorphised animals and a succession of frankly dazzling action sequences in which the main characters make their way through an unseeing human world.
MLive.com," July 11, 2016",John Serba," The brilliant animation functions with symbolic profundity, for the film is all about Dory exploring her own deep blues, an elusive sadness she can't identify, tugging from a place within."
South China Morning Post," July 11, 2016",Richard James Havis," It has a breathless, often frantic storyline that doesn't add up to much. But the beautifully rendered undersea locations and a rip-roaring nail-biter of an ending make up for the slack."

Cairo360," July 6, 2016",Marija Loncarevic," While it may not be as engrossing as its predecessor, Pixar's follow-up to its 2003's animated smash-hit Finding Nemo still manages to find its own groove."

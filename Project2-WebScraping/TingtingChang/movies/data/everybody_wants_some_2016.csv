Film Ireland Magazine," January 3, 2017",Deirdre Molumby," There is a lot of fun and laughter to be had here, and I guarantee you'll come out of the theatre smiling."
Total Film," January 2, 2017",Jamie Graham," Party on, dudes! With tracks from Blondie, Van Halen, Sugar Hill Gang, The Cars and more, Linklater's frat-pack com is an absolute blast. Prepare to be amazed and amused."
TheShiznit.co.uk," January 1, 2017",Ed Williamson," Linklater presents a time in life, a few days, showing it up for what it is: a laugh while it's happening, its specific events likely soon forgotten, but no less significant for it."
3AW," December 26, 2016",Jim Schembri," Likeable, inconsequential comedy ramble about an assortment of baseball jocks who share a frat house at a Texas college."
Sunday Times (UK)," December 17, 2016",Camilla Long," At last, a proper summery hit."
Movie Habit," December 12, 2016",Robert Denerstein," For the most part, Everybody Wants Some!! is a shambling, rambling look at young people who have yet to become interesting. Judging by the movie, they may never actually achieve that status."
Arkansas Democrat-Gazette," November 14, 2016",Piers Marchant," Pointlessness is an important element in a Linklater film, but this one never is able to make much of a purpose for itself."
Japan Times," November 9, 2016",Giovanni Fazio, It's all a bit of a bro'verdose.
Pajiba," September 21, 2016",Rebecca Pahle," Honestly, it's pretty compelling."
Movie Talk," September 21, 2016",Jason Best, Frat-boy jocks usually get a bad rap in movies (filmmakers tend not to be former jocks). Yet Linklater captures his characters' bantering camaraderie and boozy machismo with disarming sympathy.
Graffiti With Punctuation," August 10, 2016",Blake Howard," Everybody Wants Some, like Dazed and Confused, feels like having old friends over, listening to records & reminiscing."

Seanax.com," July 16, 2016",Sean Axmaker, Linklater offers astute observations about college life and young adults exploring their first taste of independence while reminding us that there's more on their minds than just getting some!!
Blog de cine," July 14, 2016",Alberto Abuín, Linklater proves his skills directing actors. Everyone is great in the film. [Full review in Spanish]
Q Network Film Desk," July 12, 2016",James Kendrick," while there is inherent diversity among these players, there is so much about them that is the same in terms of personality, desires, and ideologies that we start longing to get out of their world and into someone else's"
Los Angeles Daily News," July 11, 2016",Rob Lowman," Richard Linklater's Everybody Wants Some!! is delightful fun, a 1980s college romp complete with sex and offbeat hijinks."
The Blu Spot," July 11, 2016",Jeff Beck," Everybody Wants Some!! may seem to set about without a purpose or direction, but under writer/director Richard Linklater's guidance, it becomes a rather entertaining character piece mixed together with a delightful nostalgia trip."
Antagony & Ecstasy," July 10, 2016",Tim Brayton," There's no such thing as an ungenerous Linklater film, but Everybody Wants Some!! is high in the running for the most generous yet."
ABC Radio Brisbane," July 10, 2016",Matthew Toomey, The film is careful not to judge or praise these characters.
Cinema Crazed," July 4, 2016",Felix Vasquez Jr.," Simple, and down to Earth in scope and vision, but brings with it an incredible series of rich and complex characters..."
BuzzFeed News," March 21, 2016",Alison Willmore," The film itself has an ease that's addictively cozy, whether its characters feel familiar or far removed. They're an endearing bunch of -- well, bros. In Linklater's dexterous hands, it doesn't feel like such a bad word."
Film Comment Magazine," March 17, 2016",Nick Pinkerton," [Linklater's] latest is, to borrow from Henry Miller, an ""incurably healthy"" film, about nothing so much as the pure pleasure of having a body and a mind to play with, and a smorgasbord of opportunities for putting both to work."
Austin American-Statesman," March 15, 2016",Joe Gross," [A] very well-acted, well-shot, elegantly edited comedy."
The Verge," March 15, 2016",Bryan Bishop," [Linklater makes] films that are unconventional in form and function, but so effortlessly entertaining... Everybody Wants Some!! still pulls that trick off, but despite its laughs and moments of fun it can't help but feel like a step back."
Vanity Fair," March 14, 2016",Joanna Robinson," There are few writer/directors out there as good at perfectly capturing the lived-in feel of a very specific time and place. And in that way, Everybody Wants Some succeeds on every level."
CinemaBlend.com," March 14, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," Like [Dazed and Confused], the movie is a celebration of the fun and freedom of youth, and it's simply in capturing this spirit that makes it succeed."
The Film Stage," March 14, 2016",Michael Snydel," In the best moments, [it] is about assimilation: a union of life-affirming music, the euphoric now, and people coming together who have nothing and everything in common."
ScreenCrush," March 14, 2016",Matt Singer," In making a movie about a baseball team hazing its new members, Linklater created a movie that feels like a hazing."

The Playlist," March 12, 2016",Charlie Schmidlin," The strength of Linklater's films have always been their ability to capture the textures of lived experience, and ""Everyone Wants Some!!"" is no different in that regard."
Collider," March 12, 2016",Perri Nemiroff," Everybody Wants Some is an opportunity to escape, live in this world for two hours and have some fun, but the experience also comes with a very important message that'll hit home for everyone. It celebrates the individual."
Consequence of Sound," March 12, 2016",Michael Roffman," A lot of it's funny - for instance, any scenes involving Powell's admittedly charming Finnegan or Hoechlin's testy McReynolds - but hanging out with these guys eventually becomes a chore."
Little White Lies," March 12, 2016",David Jenkins, A marvel. The 'best film of 2016' race starts here.
Hollywood Reporter," March 12, 2016",John DeFore," It's as honest and clear-eyed about the past as its predecessor, another in a filmography of unpredictable gems."
Guardian," March 12, 2016",Nigel M. Smith," Finn makes for a bit of bland protagonist, but he's nicely balanced out by his outlandish teammates, each so clearly defined by Linklater's subtly incisive screenplay."
Screen International," March 12, 2016",David D'Arcy," Linklater does connect you with the fun that he must have had in those days. If you can take the testosterone, you'll have a good time."
Variety," March 12, 2016",Justin Chang, Few filmmakers have so fully embraced the bittersweet joy of living in the moment - one that's all the more glorious because it fades so soon.
We Got This Covered," March 11, 2016",Matt Donato," Everybody Wants Some brilliantly, and hilariously, uses sexuality to mask the film's more dominant and profound theme - living with passion."
Chicago Tribune," March 31, 2016",Michael Phillips," Consider ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" as both a fond exercise in remembrance and a movie that, at its best, works for people of Linklater's age as well as the people Linklater and company were, once upon a time."
Entertainment Weekly," March 31, 2016",Chris Nashawaty," Everybody Wants Some!! may be a little shambling and uneventful. But like college, it's the late aimless nights and idle afternoons that you look back on most fondly when you get older."
Nerdist," March 30, 2016",Luke Y. Thompson," ...not quite true to life, but it is true to a condensed point-of-view looking back."
AV Club," March 30, 2016",A.A. Dowd," In its funky, aimless, winningly juvenile way, Everybody Wants Some is about as inclusively celebratory as any college comedy in memory: Per its title, it really does want everybody to get some."
Playboy Online," March 30, 2016",Stephen Rebello," A breezy memory film with period details as dead-on as anyone expect from Linklater and without a mean bone in its body, it's a twangy, loping charmer."
NOW Toronto," March 30, 2016",Norman Wilner," Structured with a deceptively casual hand, it's charming and smartly observed throughout, and the ensemble cast vanish into their period roles. "
Slant Magazine," March 30, 2016",Carson Lund, The film luxuriates in a world that's the platonic ideal of youthful indulgence.
MovieWeb," March 30, 2016",Julian Roman," Richard Linklater returns to his Dazed and Confused form with another lighthearted, supremely enjoyable tale of youth - Everybody Wants Some. This eighties party is a blast. "
Rolling Stone," March 30, 2016",Peter Travers," Leave it to Linklater to create a nonstop party that keeps ringing undertones of what happens when the party's over. That's what makes it a Linklater film. He builds human comedies, the kind that last."
USA Today," March 30, 2016",Brian Truitt," A winningly retro slice-of-life look at a weekend in the life of some Texas ballplayers seeking girls, tunes and identity."
Den of Geek," March 30, 2016",Edward Douglas, A cast of talented young actors helps give Linklater's '80s throwback just the right balance of juvenile humor and heady intelligence

Metro," March 29, 2016",Matt Prigge, If it's truly a spiritual sequel to anything it's 'Magic Mike XXL': a good times romp that ends with the realization that the good times one day end. 
Film Journal International," March 29, 2016",Tomris Laffly," With charm and a laid-back attitude, it seizes wit and wisdom in carefree moments of youth."
The New Republic," March 29, 2016",Tim Grierson," Richard Linklater has crafted another of his poignant reveries -- not about how youth is squandered on the young but, rather, how youth is actually lived by the young. "
Village Voice," March 29, 2016",Bilge Ebiri, The experience of watching this film is one of reflective exuberance. It's a movie about people who arrive sure of themselves and depart in the quiet confidence that all they know is that they know nothing.
Film Journal International," March 28, 2016",Rebecca Pahle," It's a light, breezy, shaggy story where the most dramatic thing that happens is a scuffle in a disco."
Reason Online," April 1, 2016",Kurt Loder," Even looser than its predecessor. Its non-story is sometimes talky and bland, and your tolerance for guy stuff may well be tested. "
Globe and Mail," April 1, 2016",John Semley," It's hard to imagine another filmmaker who could invest the lives of straight, middle-class, norm-y, aggressively bro-y, immaculately groomed college sports jocks with a sense of vital anarchy and resounding humanity."
AARP Movies for Grownups," March 31, 2016",Bill Newcott," The music is authentic, but to steal an SAT analogy, the characters are to real students as the chorus line in South Pacific was to real sailors: caricatures created to tell us things we already know about the virtues and deficits of callow youth."
Beliefnet," March 31, 2016",Nell Minow, So much fun that it is easy to overlook how sweet it is and how smart it is. 
People Magazine," March 31, 2016",Alynda Wheat," [Everybody Wants Some!!] is so good-natured and sweet, so confident in its understanding of time and place, so unrelentingly funny, you won't want to leave."
National Post," March 31, 2016",Chris Knight," It captures a specific time, with its goofball moustaches and too-tight tees, clearly but without any drippy nostalgia. "
Toronto Sun," March 31, 2016",Jim Slotek," The film - which is being marketed as ""a spiritual sequel"" to Linklater's Dazed And Confused (and a ""more chill"" Animal House by the director himself) - meanders from minor adventure to minor adventure, with exchanges of amiable dude existentialism."
Chicago Reader," March 31, 2016",J. R. Jones," I kept pulling away from the whole thing, admiring as always Linklater's skilled direction of the ongoing bull session but concluding soon enough that bull was all the movie had to offer. "
Wall Street Journal," March 31, 2016",Joe Morgenstern, Loose-jointed and endearing ...

Toronto Star," March 31, 2016",Peter Howell, Richard Linklater's idea of a baseball movie is one where the first pitch isn't thrown until the 90-minute mark.
Washington Post," March 31, 2016",Ann Hornaday," As small and specific as it is, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" feels improbably expansive, even universal."
New York Post," March 31, 2016",Kyle Smith," At his best, Linklater gives the characters the space for quietly revealing moments."
Austin Chronicle," March 31, 2016",Marc Savlov," This is Linklater at his best, recalling the relatively recent past intimately and with obvious affection, and, of course, with one hell of a killer soundtrack. I want some more."
TIME Magazine," March 31, 2016",Stephanie Zacharek," Everybody Wants Some!! captures the essence of all sorts of youthful desires, both those that are easily identifiable and the more aching, unnameable kind."
San Francisco Chronicle," March 31, 2016",Mick LaSalle," Linklater somehow succeeds in showing just how sex-obsessed young men are at this age, without softening or sentimentalizing them, or making them obnoxious."
RogerEbert.com," March 31, 2016",Sheila O'Malley," Linklater approaches all of this with affection, and even kindness-one of his distinguishing characteristics. ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a corrective to the tired, false ""dumb jock"" stereotype."
Slate," March 31, 2016",Dan Kois," I worried I'd be disappointed by Everybody Wants Some!!, even though one of my favorite directors made it. But I loved it."
The Nation," April 6, 2016",Stuart Klawans," When you look back on this comedy of jock manners... you marvel at how economically Linklater has wafted you along, using little more than breezy moods, plotless good spirits, and the rhythms of an encyclopedically eclectic pop sound track."
Seattle Times," April 6, 2016",Soren Anderson," Though it's a super accurate rendering of the time period it portrays, the picture is also universal in its appeal."
BBC.com," April 5, 2016",Owen Gleiberman, Everybody Wants Some!! is about the moment when youth culture began to evolve into a cult of team players. It taps into how the freewheeling '70s gave way to a spirit of creeping conformism. 
Birth.Movies.Death.," April 5, 2016",Devin Faraci," In a world full of toxic masculinity, of #notallmen a-holes and GamerGate creeps, Everybody Wants Some!! is a welcome reminder that being a man isn't inherently bad. "
Groucho Reviews," April 5, 2016",Peter Canavese, An art-house Animal House.
New Yorker," April 4, 2016",Anthony Lane," Linklater barely puts a foot wrong, and he shows that a movie about happiness can be cogent and robust, rather than sappy or wispy; and yet, for all its gambolling mischief, ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" leaves us with plenty to rue."
The Patriot Ledger," April 3, 2016",Dana Barbuto," Richard Linklater's collegiate comedy ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a two-exclamation-point romp."
Under the Radar," April 3, 2016",Shawn Hazelett," Unfortunately, [Blake] Jenner's screentime mostly consists of a lack of spatial awareness and poor, unemotive line readings."
Cinemalogue.com," April 1, 2016",Todd Jorgenson, ... weaves broad and formulaic elements into a celebration of nostalgia that resonates with authenticity.
Time Out," April 1, 2016",Joshua Rothkopf, It's Linklater in a nostalgic mood-but also his most deeply felt piece of growing up.
Reeling Reviews," April 1, 2016",Laura Clifford," this being Linklater, there are many insights into just what it means to find one's path in life even if the only route his characters seek is the quickest to the next beer, bong or booty."
Paste Magazine," April 1, 2016",Nick Schager," A sporadically amusing, if unconvincing, film eager to imagine jocks as horndogs with hearts of gold."
NY1-TV," April 1, 2016",Neil Rosen," If you look past the laughs, partying and hijinks, you will see that Linklater is going for something more; a philosophy of being in the present and not trying too hard to figure out your entire life when you are only 18."
MTV," April 1, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Before Midnight convinced us that Linklater had become one of the most emotionally mature filmmakers of his generation. With Everybody Wants Some!!, he has a lame midlife crisis."
Cambridge Day," April 1, 2016",Tom Meek, The cast of slightly known actors also works to the film's favor. All play their part on the well-balanced roster.
Boston Herald," April 1, 2016",James Verniere," Dazed and Confused meets Before Sunrise, an Animal House for a new generation."
Boston Globe," April 1, 2016",Ty Burr," ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" is a nice long soak in the Proustian detritus of its era."
The Young Folks," April 1, 2016",Allyson Johnson," Timeless, engaging but a little rough around the edges, it's not quite one of Linklater's best but it's something special."
The Atlantic," April 1, 2016",David Sims," It's an effortless cult classic, delivered by a master of the form, and one of the first truly must-see movies of 2016."
Movie Mezzanine," April 1, 2016",Vikram Murthi," ...for now, as the song says, let the good times roll."
ReelViews," April 8, 2016",James Berardinelli," Although this may be ""lesser"" Linklater, it's still more enjoyable than a lot of what's currently available in theaters."
Tampa Bay Times," April 8, 2016",Steve Persall," ... as playfully raunchy as any sex comedy doubling down on exclamation points can be. Like its kindred predecessor, it's also wise about basically good people being dazed and very confused."
New York Magazine/Vulture," April 8, 2016",David Edelstein, What everybody wants in Everybody Wants Some!! is not just sex and success on the field. It's what we all want. It's time.
The Newnan Times-Herald," April 8, 2016",Jonathan W. Hickman," We don't get an unhinged conclusion like ""Animal House,"" but, at the same time, there is very little edge to the movie."
Screen It!," April 8, 2016",Jim Judy," A pleasant enough and charming if decidedly adult diversion that's likely going to be the springboard for launching one or more new Hollywood star careers. (Full Content Review for Parents -- Violence, Profanity, etc. -- Also Available)"
HollywoodInToto.com," April 8, 2016",Christian Toto, You can practically smell the stale beer in Everybody Wants Some!! But do we really wanna drink it?

Common Sense Media," April 7, 2016",Jeffrey M. Anderson," With laid-back ease and an organic understanding of characters and dialogue, Richard Linklater (Boyhood) has crafted an excellent, breezy comedy."
Philadelphia Inquirer," April 7, 2016",Steven Rea," It's almost an anthropological study: a tribe in its native habitat - batting practice, bar fights, babes (or so they hope, obsessively)."
Arizona Republic," April 7, 2016",Bill Goodykoontz, Everybody Wants Some!! is a terrifically entertaining movie that proves Linklater once again a master of perfectly capturing moments in time without judgment or apology.
Minneapolis Star Tribune," April 7, 2016",Colin Covert," A warm, meandering salute to South Texas small college life circa 1980, this feels like a comedy based on real life, and one of the most likable chapters in a remarkably affable directing career."
One Guy's Opinion," April 7, 2016",Frank Swietek," Deliriously gleeful...a sort of cinematic kegger, loose, informal and not a little ragged, that reminds you in a penetrating but not hectoring way of what it was like to be young and full of possibility."
San Diego Reader," April 7, 2016",Matthew Lickona, The whole thing feels like a fond reminiscence conducted under the influence of some blissful chemical that allows you to remember things the way they should have been.

AllMovie," April 7, 2016",Daniel Gelb," Linklater balances the wistful glow of memory with a quick-witted script, a tremendous young cast, and a vibe of effortless cool that has defined his filmmaking career."
Miami Herald," April 7, 2016",Rene Rodriguez, Everybody Wants Some!! is the rare sort of raunchy American comedy that allows as much time for scenes of people simply talking as it does for mud-wrestling matches and bar brawls
Truthdig," April 6, 2016",Carrie Rickey," Linklater's singularity as a director lies in his sympathy for his characters: He likes them all, no matter how flawed."
New York Observer," April 6, 2016",Rex Reed," I admire Richard Linklater, but anyone who fixates on memories like these suffers from a case of arrested development. It all looks like old reruns of dated TV sitcoms, like Welcome Back, Kotter."
Thrillist," April 6, 2016",Matt Patches," The best movie of the year (so far) ... the perfect kick-back-and-chill movie, a combo of fastball jokes and unexpected wisdom backed by a 1980s jukebox."
Charlotte Observer," April 21, 2016",Lawrence Toppman," If this project is some kind of huge in-joke, I'm willing to admit I didn't get it. But if I did get it (and I'm afraid I did), it's a huge disappointment."

Blu-ray.com," April 20, 2016",Brian Orndorf," In trying to recapture one of his greatest creative successes, Linklater goes too slack. I'm sure ""Everybody Wants Some"" was fun to make, but it's a chore to sit through."
Aisle Seat," April 20, 2016",Mike McGranaghan," Sharp, funny, and infectiously nostalgic. Everybody Wants Some!! is filled with moments where you relate to the youthful, carefree spirit Linklater so carefully evokes."

Associated Press," April 19, 2016",Jake Coyle," [Linklater's] light touch remains a marvel. Though his characters are often just bouncing from conversation to conversation, night out to night out, the film's direction is never lackadaisical."
Tiny Mix Tapes," April 19, 2016",Derek Smith, It still comes off as another unique entry in the Linklater canon in its careful balancing of full-on machismo-filled bro-down comedy with more tender scenes of genuine male bonding.

Detroit News," April 15, 2016",Adam Graham," Imagine ""Porky's"" as an intelligent character study and you're on the right path."
Kansas City Star," April 14, 2016",Jon Niccum," In trying to reconstruct a specific time and place, Linklater doesn't drive the story forward. He even inserts a timer between scenes to count down the hours before classes start, which only underscores the missing tension in the narrative."
Bullz-Eye.com," April 14, 2016",Jason Zingale, A really enjoyable period comedy that perfectly captures small-town college life through Linklater's nostalgia-tinted glasses.
Movie Nation," April 14, 2016",Roger Moore," Sophomoric, a real regression from the ambition of ""Boyhood"""

LarsenOnFilm," April 12, 2016",Josh Larsen," ...intimately genial, like a platonic pat on the butt."
Flavorwire," April 9, 2016",Jason Bailey," The two films share a vibe, an approach, which is shaggy, giggly, and loose-limbed. They're both hangout movies, in the best possible sense."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," April 8, 2016",Robert Horton," Not much happens, but the movie's got a great affection for its jock characters and a wonderful flow."
GQ Magazine [UK]," May 10, 2016",Becky Lucas," All this whacky mirth, mayhem and lack of plot could irritate all of us over 25s were the team all mere meatheads. Thankfully they're not... they're a witty, articulate bunch."
The Jacobin," May 10, 2016",Eileen Jones, I generally can't sustain thoughts about Linklater's work. I only retain a general sense of having periodically wasted hours of my life that I'm never getting back.
MLive.com," May 10, 2016",John Serba," The film's slyly profound tagline reads, ""Here for a good time. Not a long time."" Subtext: enjoy it while it's here, because it'll be gone before you know it."
The List," May 9, 2016",James Mottram," Some will balk at the macho sexism that runs rife, but Linklater perfectly captures the lust for life that accompanies those early college days. It's magical."
Daily Star," May 7, 2016",Andy Lea," Linklater has crafted another star-free, period drama that perfectly recreates the spirit of a year and the age of its characters."
Uncut Magazine [UK]," May 5, 2016",Michael Bonner," The jocks in Linklater's film are miles apart from today's frat movie characters; these are mostly clever, curious and likeable, their camaraderie given a tender spin by Linklater."
Flavorwire," May 5, 2016",Lara Zarum," The ""some"" that everybody wants here is plainly sex, but the gang engages in enough undergraduate philosophizing to suggest that they're hoping to get more than just laid. "
The Skinny," May 5, 2016",Philip Concannon," Linklater's typically fluid, relaxed direction makes it a pleasure to spend time in the company of these characters."
Missoula Independent," May 1, 2016",Molly Laich, Every conflict is undercut with a breezy reassurance that college is awesome!!

RedEye," April 22, 2016",Lauren Chval," [Linklater's] trademark introspection makes ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" funny and affecting, if familiar. When you're dealing with nostalgia, that's not such a terrible thing."
Sacramento News & Review," April 22, 2016",Jim Lane," The movie is good fun, with Linklater's trademark dizzy, sparkling R-rated dialogue and, like Dazed and Confused 23 years ago, a soundtrack chock full of nostalgic 1980s rock 'n' roll."
Salt Lake Tribune," April 22, 2016",Sean P. Means, The maverick Texas filmmaker throws a wild party that's also a sneakily deep look back at a time when everything appeared possible.
Fort Worth Weekly," April 21, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," Linklater still knows how to depict the young person's quest to find his or her own purpose in the world, a meaning beyond themselves, and communion with another human soul. This is why he remains a treasure of American cinema."
Cleveland Plain Dealer," April 21, 2016",Michael Heaton, Despite Linklater's best efforts the movie goes nowhere because the narrative is pretty much non-existent.
NUVO Newsweekly," April 21, 2016",Edward Johnson-Ott, Everybody Wants Some!! is a highly entertaining production that's easily as good as its title is bad.
Scotsman," May 15, 2016",Alistair Harkness, A hugely enjoyable ode to the value of hanging out at the one time in your life where you're free from both the constraints of high school and the pressures of proper adulthood.
London Evening Standard," May 15, 2016",Charlotte O'Sullivan," Everybody Wants Some!! is obsessed with seduction. Don't let me stop you going all the way with Linklater. I'm just here to warn you that, with regards to this film, he doesn't go very deep."
Observer (UK)," May 15, 2016",Wendy Ide," The picture works best if you reserve judgment - yes, some of the attitudes towards women are a little unreformed and some of the characters are puddle deep - and enjoy the show."
Irish Independent," May 13, 2016",Paul Whitington," Mr Linklater may be a fan of Marcel Proust, because this film is suffused with a heady nostalgia for the lost past."
The Herald (Ireland)," May 13, 2016",Chris Wasser," The magic of Linklater's detailed, conversational piece... is in the performances (brilliant and, occasionally, affectionate) and the dialogue (sharp and endlessly witty)."
Daily Express (UK)," May 13, 2016",Allan Hunter," The dialogue is witty, the sense of period is spot on and there is also a vulnerability beneath the bluster and bravado of young men enjoying the time of their lives."
Daily Mirror (UK)," May 13, 2016",David Edwards," Sweet, honest and, most of all, richly enjoyable."
Sky Movies," May 12, 2016",Elliott Noble," Put on your party shirt, grab a brew, and waste some precious time."
Radio Times," May 12, 2016",Karen Krizanovich," Pacey and completely entertaining, this comedy rocks."
Daily Mail (UK)," May 12, 2016",Brian Viner," There is much to enjoy, especially for those of us who were also students back then - albeit a long way from Texas."
The Arts Desk," May 12, 2016",Nick Hasted," Linklater's non-judgemental observations of thoughtfully unpredictable characters do, though, make it linger in the mind."
Independent (UK)," May 12, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," After his intimate, generation-spanning epic Boyhood, Richard Linklater is back with an equally special and magical film, albeit one with a much tighter focus."
New Statesman," May 12, 2016",Ryan Gilbey, Linklater is too besotted with his male creations to see that they can be divided almost without exception between the bland and the obnoxious. Even his usual eye for detail is a little off.
The Spectator," May 12, 2016",Deborah Ross," I was fed up of them all by the end, I have to say."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," May 12, 2016",Robbie Collin," The look of the film - hair, costumes, even sunlight - is exactly right. The sound of it is even better. Music constantly plays from ubiquitous car stereos and turntables, and every scene has its own groove."
Financial Times," May 12, 2016",Nigel Andrews," For someone humming much the same tune from film to film, Linklater has an amazing versatility."
Guardian," May 12, 2016",Peter Bradshaw," A deceptively subtle comedy, and also a challengingly and almost provokingly unironic film intensifying and cartoonifying what it is like to be young and male ..."
WOW247," May 12, 2016",Matthew Turner," Serving up a heady combination of laugh-out-loud humour, likeable characters and powerful nostalgia, this is a treat from start to finish. "
Ozus' World Movie Reviews," May 11, 2016",Dennis Schwartz," It scores a few runs with its engaging characters and spicy dialogue but does not swing for the long ball, as it's content to just score enough to win."
CineVue," May 11, 2016",Adam Lowes, A joyous and often uproarious portrayal of college-age adolescence and the alluring freedom that brings. 
Sensacine," July 4, 2016",Carlos Losilla," Cinema in its purest form, and the film doesn't even try to brag about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
Cinemanía (Spain)," June 30, 2016",Carlos Marañón," The spirit of Dazed and Confused goes to the 80s. Relaxed, charming and unforgettable. [Full review in Spanish]"
Blog de cine," June 30, 2016",Mikel Zorrilla, We need more movies like this. [Full review in Spanish]
Sydney Morning Herald," June 29, 2016",Sandra Hall," There's no storyline. The script just drifts from one vignette to the next as the boys cruise around, ogling girls, haunting the campus night spots and staging a party while their house does its best to remain standing under their assaults."
Trespass," June 29, 2016",Alex Doenau," Here we have a celebration of male camaraderie and masculinity that comes at the expense of no one, a sex comedy that is both sexy and comedic."
ABC Radio (Australia)," June 28, 2016",CJ Johnson," The film is set in 1980, the lads all want to ""get some"" - sex - and the film's politics are no more advanced than those of Porky's (1981) - which is, incidentally, a better movie, and has the benefit of looking more comfortable in its own period clothes."
Junkee," June 24, 2016",Lauren Carroll Harris," Linklater's 1980 is a world that's so perfect in its contours, so detailed in its realisation, and quite delightful to inhabit for two hours."
Student Edge," June 23, 2016",Simon Miraudo, Shaggy and loose (unlike the characters' shorts)... There are worse groups to hang with.
News.com.au," June 23, 2016",Wenlei Ma," Despite its easygoing spirit, Everybody is tightly structured, framed by four parties and a countdown clock to the start of classes. For a movie that's pretty much about nothing, it's incredibly well-paced and never overstays its welcome."
Daily Telegraph (Australia)," June 23, 2016",Vicky Roach," Special mention should go to the Everybody Want Some!! hair and make-up department -- the lead actors' retro look is so convincing, you'd swear you were watching a documentary."
Urban Cinefile," June 23, 2016",Andrew L. Urban," If you feel a sigh of nostalgia for the era and what you were doing or being at the time, maybe you would get a bigger hit from the film than I."
Urban Cinefile," June 23, 2016",Louise Keller," There is something infectious about the spontaneity on display as it captures the joys of self-discovery, exploring life and having fun. If we could only bottle that feeling!"
4:3," June 22, 2016",Jaymes Durante," This is a riot of a movie, drenched in sunny naivete and paced at an open, lackadaisical beat."
Herald Sun (Australia)," June 22, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," Linklater and his largely unknown ensemble of actors capture the true essence of these hazy, halcyon days with great humour, heart and warmth."
The Age (Australia)," June 22, 2016",Jake Wilson, It's as if Linklater is bound by a bro code that obliges him to present these guys in a basically uncritical light.
Baltimore Magazine," June 13, 2016",Max Weiss, Linklater has audaciously made a movie about our most maligned subset of young men -- bros -- and forced us to admit that we actually like them.
Washington City Paper," May 20, 2016",Noah Gittell," Pleasingly aimless, often hilarious ."
Sight and Sound," May 20, 2016",Pamela Hutchinson," There's none of the humiliating gross-out humour that dominates modern teen comedy, giving the film an affable, breezy appeal -- although, as often happens in Linklater-land, apparently light-hearted scenes are tinged with violence."
Contactmusic.com," May 18, 2016",Rich Cline," Richard Linklater loosely follows on from two of his most acclaimed films with this lively university comedy set in 1980. It's billed as a ""spiritual sequel"" to his high school classic Dazed and Confused, which was set in the late 1970s."
Sunday Independent (Ireland)," May 16, 2016",Hilary A White," An unassuming, soft-centred delight."

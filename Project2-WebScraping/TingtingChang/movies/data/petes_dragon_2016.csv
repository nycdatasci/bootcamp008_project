Sci-Fi Movie Page," August 11, 2016",Rob Vaux," It's a deeply affecting experience, and while the film remains just a boy-and-his-dragon story in the end, its depths hold wisdom and comfort."
Daily Mail (UK)," August 11, 2016",Brian Viner," I took my twin ten-year-old nieces and they sat on the edge of their seats throughout, utterly rapt, then pronounced the film 'really, really, really good'."
Dallas Morning News," August 11, 2016",Nancy Churnin," Pete's Dragon may owe more to E.T.: The Extraterrestrial, along with a dash of The Jungle Book,than it does to the original Pete's Dragon."
Kansas City Star," August 11, 2016",Loey Lockerby," The goofy, cartoonish elements are gone, as are the musical numbers. But no one can quite settle on what should replace them."
New York Times," August 11, 2016",Glenn Kenny," It is slightly unfair to say that this reboot of ""Pete's Dragon"" is middling on a larger scale, but it's not entirely inaccurate either."
Independent (UK)," August 11, 2016",Geoffrey Macnab," Pete's Dragon, a remake of a 1977 Disney movie, is a determinedly old-fashioned kids' film, consummately crafted and with a subtlety that brasher, noisier children's movies conspicuously lack."
Beliefnet," August 11, 2016",Nell Minow, Genuinely enchanting.
Austin American-Statesman," August 11, 2016",Joe Gross," Most other kids' movies are so frenetic, so manic with lousy jokes and easy gags and visual effluvia that something as calm in spots as Pete's Dragon seems like an outlier."
Fort Worth Weekly," August 11, 2016",Kristian M. Lin," The near-feral child at the center of this movie puts it on the same turf as the remake of The Jungle Book, but Pete's Dragon is a better film in almost every way, and it succeeds where The BFG notably failed. "
Salt Lake Tribune," August 11, 2016",Sean P. Means, The subtly beautiful Pete's Dragon is a family drama that works because it doesn't talk down to children.
L.A. Biz," August 11, 2016",Annlee Ellingson," [Director David] Lowery may be retreading familiar territory here, but he does it well."
The Sun (UK)," August 11, 2016",Jamie East, This is old-school Disney using 2016 magic.
Rolling Stone," August 11, 2016",Peter Travers," Thanks to director David Lowery's humanizing magic, this tale of an orphan boy and a dragon is that rare family film you really can take to heart. "
NPR," August 11, 2016",Scott Tobias," Lowery's affecting tearjerker strips away the excess and keeps on stripping, until all that's left is the elemental friendship between boy and beast and a lovely affirmation of family, community, and the preciousness of the natural world."
CinemaBlend.com," August 11, 2016",Eric Eisenberg," David Lowery has crafted a beautiful, earnest family film with wonderful emotion and pathos that should see it continually watched for years."
Mark Reviews Movies," August 11, 2016",Mark Dujsik," None of this works if the dragon isn't convincing, both as an effect and as a character. It is on both counts..."
New York Post," August 11, 2016",Kyle Smith," A cinematic enchantment, a low-key 1970s-style kids' movie brimming with sincerity and heart. It's one of the best films of the year."
Wall Street Journal," August 11, 2016",Joe Morgenstern," Elliott breathes fire, and the film around him breathes humanity."

Slate," August 12, 2016",Dan Kois," Pete's Dragon is a gentle, understated family adventure, one that feels notably unlike the simplistically sentimental product the Disney imprimatur might lead you to expect."
RTÉ (Ireland)," August 12, 2016",Sinead Brennan," Great kids' films will always have something there for the adults but there is no appeal here. Children may get lost in a sense of wonder at the incredibly cute Elliott, but there are better films out there that would be worth picking up instead."
"HeraldNet (Everett, WA)"," August 12, 2016",Robert Horton, An offbeat underwhelmer with moments of quiet charm.
Toledo Blade," August 12, 2016",Kirk Baird," Pete's Dragon is delightfully low key and delicate... It's a film about characters, story, and emotions that also happens to have a CGI dragon in it -- one that is effectively brought to life through the animation."
"Deseret News, Salt Lake City"," August 12, 2016",Josh Terry, A contemplative and beautiful movie with just enough action to keep things interesting.
NYC Movie Guru," August 12, 2016",Avi Offer," Strong, heartfelt performances barely compensate for the dull screenplay. It ultimately lacks the magic of the classic children's book."
National Catholic Register," August 12, 2016",Steven D. Greydanus," A rare family film that takes its time and allows the characters to breathe, to romp in the forest, to gaze at stars...I wish I'd grown up watching this film instead of the original."

Irish Independent," August 12, 2016",Paul Whitington," This tale is very well told, nicely paced and perfectly pitched in a movie that doesn't make the mistake of outstaying its welcome. And like all the best children's films, it reminds world-weary parents what being a kid actually feels like."

Christianity Today," August 12, 2016",Alissa Wilkinson," It's an uplifting tearjerker, and deserving of your box-office dollars."

MTV," August 12, 2016",Amy Nicholson," Picture the exec who said that scales might be too strange, as though asking kids to dream wasn't the point"
New York Magazine/Vulture," August 12, 2016",David Edelstein," After half an hour or so of ... stutter steps, Pete's Dragon starts working on you, much like those gold standards of the boy-and-his-otherworldly-friend genre, E.T. and The Iron Giant."

Your Movies (cleveland.com)," August 12, 2016",John Urbancich," ""The (new) Jungle Book"" it's certainly not, but anyone with a heart should enjoy ""Pete's"" easy-going resolution."
Las Vegas Review-Journal," August 12, 2016",Christopher Lawrence," Pete's Dragon is genial and family friendly. But there's entirely too much setup, precious little action, not much magic, and even at 103 minutes it feels at least 20 too long."
Common Sense Media," August 12, 2016",Yvonne Condes," Wonderful remake of Disney classic has peril, sad moments. "
Tri-City Herald," August 12, 2016",Gary Wolcott," Nothing like the original. No music thankfully. Manipulative and if you're emotional or taking kids, it's a two hanky movie. Kids might like it. Adults will be bored. "
Laramie Movie Scope," August 17, 2016",Robert Roten," This film packs an emotional punch. It is well acted and directed. There is action and there is spectacle, but it doesn't overwhelm the story, which is essentially about human relationships, friendships and love."

HitFix," August 17, 2016",Drew McWeeny," Our best fables and fairy tales are the ones that speak truth, and this version of Pete's Dragon easily takes its place on any short list of the great films for young audiences as a result. "
New York Observer," August 17, 2016",Oliver Jones," Pete's Dragon is one of those movies that talks a lot about magic-Robert Redford, the grandfatherly narrator whose ""by and by"" bookends the film, says the word at least seven times-rather than effectively presenting it on screen."
Flavorwire," August 16, 2016",Jason Bailey," Lowery's not just an artisan crafting what could've been product - he's creating a road map for how these remakes should be done, if, indeed, that's where we're going anyway."

EricDSnider.com," August 15, 2016",Eric D. Snider," Free of the flamboyance that marks so many kids' movies, and of the winking references to the past that plague so many remakes, Lowery's vision is wonderful and big-hearted, beautiful inside and out."

The Young Folks," August 15, 2016",Jon Winkler, Pete's Dragon is so preserved in its own universe and separate from the commercialism of modern kid's movies that it's actually quite refreshing. 
Creative Loafing," August 14, 2016",Matt Brunson," The gentle nature and leisurely pace might cause a few Coked out kids to fidget, but most should react positively to the picture's sense of adventure and discovery."
Radio Times," August 14, 2016",David Aldridge," By turns funny, sad, scary and exciting, this is terrific family entertainment, though children who are easily upset may be disturbed by some of the intense action scenes."

Daily Express (UK)," August 14, 2016",Allan Hunter, It may be extremely slight and even too wholesome for modern tastes but Pete's Dragon is still welcome family fare.
Observer (UK)," August 14, 2016",Wendy Ide," Although the pathos is ladled on a little over-generously, the handsome photography, the first-rate performances ... and an endearing overgrown puppy of a dragon make this a strong alternative to animation for family audiences."
The Patriot Ledger," August 14, 2016",Dana Barbuto," .... their scenes together are fun to watch. Really, could there ever be a better best friend than a fire-breathing dragon who likes to cuddle?"
Maven's Nest," August 13, 2016",Nora Lee Mandel," While I think that the angry dragon's fire would singe his inappropriate fur, this new version is a pleasing, lovely-looking family film."

Suburban Journals of St. Louis," August 13, 2016",Mathew DeKinder," The original 'Pete's Dragon' wasn't much more than a goofy flight of fancy. The remake, while well-made and well-acted, feels lifeless and uninspired."
Ex-Press.com," August 13, 2016",Katherine Monk," Our desire to believe in the magical burns bright in childhood, but it's a fire that experience in a frequently cruel world eventually snuffs out. Pete's Dragon has enough charm to rekindle that flame. "
Herald Sun (Australia)," September 14, 2016",Leigh Paatsch," Viewed independently of its problematic pedigree, however, this gently meandering affair only just gets by."
Contactmusic.com," September 13, 2016",Rich Cline, Hugely enjoyable.
The Sunday Age," September 13, 2016",Craig Mathieson," The result is unusually small and surprisingly genuine for a modern Disney production. The film values friendship, but also acknowledges trauma."

Indie London," August 18, 2016",Rob Carnevale," A remake of the part animated 1977 film of the same name, this completely live action version re-imagines the story and emerges as a film capable of captivating both children and adults alike."

3AW," October 18, 2016",Jim Schembri," Eventful, issue-driven, well-mounted if somewhat gloomy reinvention of the ""lost"" 1977 Disney family film...A good ride that feeds the public's seemingly insatiable hunger for dragons."

Flicks.co.nz," September 15, 2016",Steve Newall, A rare delight in how it respects the intelligence of its audience while still offering up lump-in-the-throat emotional beats in service of a welcomely straightforward story.
The Standard," September 15, 2016",Matt Neal," Like a great modern song, it somehow feels new and classic at the same time."
ScreenCrush," August 3, 2016",Erin Whitney, What Lowery's remake does best is convey classic Disney magic in a family film that's as uplifting for kids as it is for adults.
Den of Geek," August 3, 2016",Edward Douglas," Dull at times but otherwise fine, this fantasy remake tends to excel from the realism instilled into its animated title character."
Daily Telegraph (UK)," August 2, 2016",Robbie Collin," The film is confident enough in its own weatherbeaten skin to take on no more plot than is strictly necessary, and its most affecting scenes are all character-driven moments with no real bearing on the story."
Guardian," August 1, 2016",Henry Barnes," The result is part ET, part Jungle Book, part Peanuts. It's sweet and soulful and Spielberg-ish, but with a bitter streak."
Total Film," August 1, 2016",Neil Smith," Rather more plodding than a story involving an invisible fire-breathing wyvern really should be, all things considered."
Eye for Film," July 31, 2016",Amber Wilkinson," The candy-coloured elements of the 1977 original have gone but, perhaps inevitably for Disney, traces of sticky sentiment remain in this otherwise enjoyably earthy re-imagining of Pete's Dragon. "

SciFiNow," July 29, 2016",Nadia Attia," The 1977 original definitely wasn't Disney on top form, but this 2016 'reimagining' of the orphan boy-meets-dragon tale certainly doesn't set the screen alight."
IGN Movies," July 28, 2016",Terri Schwartz," Pete's Dragon is a remake in all the right ways, taking cues from the original but reimagining the story for a very different audience living in a very different era."
Empire Magazine," July 28, 2016",Olly Richards, Strong performances and direction make the most of a lightweight tale.
Village Voice," July 27, 2016",Bilge Ebiri," More than anything, this is a slice-of-life tale, whisper-thin but still full of feeling and a generous sense of place. With the world's most adorable dragon at the center of it all."
Slant Magazine," July 27, 2016",Richard Larson," It abandons its subtlety and sense of mystery en route to becoming a typically moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family, alongside an obvious but never-quite-resolved cautionary tale about the importance of conservation."
Forbes," July 27, 2016",Mark Hughes," Pete's Dragon is an excellent entry in Disney's catalog of live-action remakes... [A]s American folktales go, it's the best I've heard in a long, long time."

Uproxx," July 27, 2016",Mike Ryan, Pete's Dragon is a better Super 8.
The Film Stage," July 27, 2016",Jordan Raup," Pete's Dragon has an emotional sensitivity, aesthetic clarity, and all-around sense of fun that creates what feels like an unearned miracle in the current summer tentpole season."
The Skinny," August 10, 2016",Joseph Walsh, A heart-warming tale of friendship (bringing to mind Spike Jonze's Where The Wild Things Are) loaded with ecological themes that is more robust and rousing than the 1977 original.
MovieWeb," August 9, 2016",Julian Roman," Disney's update of Pete's Dragon isn't nearly as whimsical as the original, but stands on its own with heart and meaning."
The New Republic," August 9, 2016",Will Leitch," The movie feels like a rock coated in cotton candy, a shiny object that simulates human-type emotions but never truly earns them."

Little White Lies," August 9, 2016",Adam Woodward, An uplifting tale that will resonate with anyone who has ever experienced love and loss.
TheFilmFile.com," August 8, 2016",Dustin Putman," A quality live-action feature conjuring the kind of brazzle-dazzle spell for which Disney is known and cherished. Musical numbers or not, ""Pete's Dragon"" is pretty enchanting."
Flick Filosopher," August 8, 2016",MaryAnn Johanson," More like a pleasant walk in a redwood forest with a boy and his dragon than a rollicking adventure, but its serenity and warm heart are infectious."
Forbes," August 8, 2016",Scott Mendelson," 'Pete's Dragon' is the best ""big"" movie of the summer. "
Newark Star-Ledger," August 8, 2016",Stephen Whitty, It may seem absurd that a creature from the Dark Ages could be hiding out just a quick car ride from Portland. But then Lowery takes you into the green hush of those dark woods and you believe.
Time Out," August 8, 2016",Cath Clarke," All the nostalgic Spielberg-y-ness of 'Stranger Things', minus the creepy kids with paranormal nosebleeds. "
The List," August 8, 2016",Kevin Harley," Instead of straining to modernise the tale or weaponise the schmaltz, [Lowery] utilises old-school charm and a timeless sense of place."

WBAI Radio," August 4, 2016",Prairie Miller," Subplots including environmental consciousness for kids never materialize enough for this mostly somber tall tale, to latch on to a clearing out of these woods.

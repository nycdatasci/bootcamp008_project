The in-app purchases are now very affordable and offer many practical items. The balance has tipped more evenly for new players to become formidable empires. The game crashes much less often however the chat service is still very glitchy.

Have been playing for over 2 years now and have never tired of it. Keeps changing and staying relevant.  Changes too fast to keep up sometimes though.  Frustrating on that part for sure.  Also, if you want to be competitive this game is not FREE!  To enjoy the game and be competitive you must spend money, and not just a little bit.  This game will run into thousands of dollars if you want to really play.  Just the truth.  I love the game and continue to spend and play.

If you don't buy the 2nd builder then when you launch the app again it tries again, and when you unlock the phone with it open it tries again, and again, and again. Even in the middle of the game it tries to sell it. It doesn't add anything to the genre it comes from, and even detracts from itself with all the sales in your face.  It also throws ""limited time offers"" at you, however if you actually watch the timer you see that when it hits 0 it sets back to its original time to try again.

Certainly worth it for a free game. What can't I say for it? Well, core game play needs a little buffing in my opinion. Constant point capturing is fun enough, but it's all you get. No real deathmatch, no CTF, just capture the points and smash the other team. Also, the graphics aren't terrible, but it's a far cry from stunning.","1,19,2017",Pixonic LLC,3,438,645,0,0.7643,0.106,0,0.221

I have done the numbers on a lot of my winnings and just 5 mins ago I had my bet at 900k, the game has 20 lines and the bet is 45000 per line and the line pays 600 x the bet per line for matching 5 so it is 600x45000 and the winnings for this is 27,000,000 million credits but they only gave me 7 million credits. This is happening on every game no matter what machine I play on, now the one thing that really is worse is that when you get the bonus they take the winning and give you 1/6th of what you are really supposed to win.

Then a bad run and went down to 2.5m. I was pretty sure that I had about 400k chips aside from the 800 I had used to buy in. Anyway, I lost a hand where I went all in with the 2.5m and found that the 400k I remembered left, had gone. Just happened again.wtf","12,25,2016",Zynga,1,512,620,0,0.7239,0.053,0,0.118

My primary issue is as an action title that the kinetics of the sprite collision need a bit more tweaking. There are several other titles similar to this game, with inferior graphics, that make you FEEL the clash and clang of sword play with more veracity.  Secondly, the sheer number of layers in game play are a bit daunting for a newbie. Complimentary, the smoothness, movement and voice acting are amazing.

That said hope you like the very first slot Dorothy and Toto.. your going to spend most of your time there due to the only slot with a pretty small minimum bet (for killing time of course)... not a bad slot at all but after staring at that same one for days or weeks you will see what I mean.

But I do. It seems to be a kind of road side robbery, albeit perhaps unintentionally by the developers. Rewards, indeed even free spins during games seem to come less and less by level 40 or so, winnings decrease substantially and the 60 million I just purchased (about 20.99 CAD) lasted not even twenty minutes - and I'm an exceedingly careful player. Not much play time for this kind of money.  But perhaps I'm on the lower end of income when it comes to playing this and others pour lots into here not realizing twenty dollars might get you twenty minutes of careful gameplay.  An otherwise fantastic game: If I were made of money. Likely uninstalling though.  Thanks for the efforts all the same, developers.","2,9,2017",Murka Ltd.,2,957,666,0,0.987,0.012,0,0.201

Exactly, they allow you to gradually level up with Shard legends until you are able to open most quests (and few other bits) which will begin to generate you some Gems and eventually give you chances to get the OP legend.   Simple. And once you get the OP legend it wouldn't take long to boost it up quickly because you'll have a high level under Monsters Attack to boost it quickly.   Yes, sure. The game does give you loads of options that allow you to buy stuff but they aren't necessary to play the game. I bought a thing or two but only because it was ether a very good deal or because I was inpatient. Not because the game made me.","2,10,2017",IGG.COM,5,1134,667,3,0.9813,0.048,0,0.157

Honestly I'm at level 21 palace and I realize that it wasn't skill but money that got me there. The packs start out at about $20 as a discount but eventually all prices for packs are $50 to $100. The problem with this game is that they make it extremely difficult to get to a competitive level without purchasing packs or using very large amounts of rare gold in game - which ultimately leads to in game purchases. At my level there are both time boosts and resources that are so high priced and so rare to acquire that I can't level anything enough to keep a self-sustaining city.  Oh and if you are attacked by a peer with a large army you can expect to have to go to in game purchases​ just to make up for your loss.

The banner rates suck, I spent 20 summons and have yet to get a banner unit, even just the base 3 star Popoi in the current event. I noticed that you guys lower the drop rates whenever there is an event where bonus units are involved, are you trying to make us spend until we get at least one banner unit???? I know it's RNG, even so we don't know what's the code behind it, meaning you could still manipulate it however you want. Please don't be too greedy, I'm also a game developer and I understand that profit is essential since gamemaking is hardwork but this is too much.

The game is down for over 24 hours way to much causing players to lose their return bonuses and making them start over.  Without the return bonus you would never have enough credits to play these games cause they cost too much per spin.  And your machines are not lose enough.  If these were play for real money machines you wouldn't have many return players.  The mobile app throws you out after every 4-6 spin.  Update:  2/10/17...game hasn't changed at all!

Building gardens,  landscaping, etc., BUT, to do anything at all you need stars. The stars are very hard to earn after just a few levels of play,  and when you do earn them, it's only one at a time. Also when a level is completed, very few coins are earned, but many, many coins are needed to get boosts, etc. to help win the levels. It is not worth it to buy any coins. Not that much fun. Could be lots better if they weren't so stingy with stars and coins. If those items were fixed, the next thing to do would be to add more choices of hardscape, plants, etc. Otherwise everyone's garden is basically similar. Boring. Do really like the characters.

Otherwise, a highly enjoyable game that will appeal to both casual phone gamers and Star Wars fans.","11,26,2016",ELECTRONIC ARTS,4,453,591,1,0.8534,0.052,0,0.192

You guys did a very good job in the new update, we have to unlock troops in one barrack and then train in all. The main point is that when you unlock a troop in two or more barracks the training time gets reduced, like when I unlocked the wizard it took four minutes to train, when I unlocked it in the second barracks it's time reduced to 1 minute .  The game would be more awesome when you get more amazing troops and all. But more further you can bring new troops and all but for lower town halls.  You can even bring a troop from clash royale.  You can even reduce the time taken to train troops, and their levelling up cost can also be increased.  Then you can get more walls like 50 walls each town hall,  then there would be 500 walls  (if you deduct the walls of th 1) .  🎉🎉😊😊😊😉😇😇","2,6,2017",Supercell,5,825,663,0,0.8804,0.018,0,0.094

Downside is PvP seems a bit laggy and most of my games tend to be me ""winning"" because my rival loses connection or something. To those that know yu-gi-oh the game is a small bit different as it's three monster, three spell/trap. However; it's pretty visually, story is interesting and the easy of getting cards is nice. You actually do not really need to spend money unless you really really want cards. If I can actually try the PvP decently I'd give this a 5 star.","1,23,2017",KONAMI,4,524,649,4,0.9322,0.041,0,0.183

Shouldn't there be five available monster and spell slots on the field 2. A max deck is 40 cards not 30 3. If a field card is in play, couldn't it alter the stadium to make it more fun. 4.

I have changed my password many times but he still login in my COC id. So plz give some solution or update in game. You can upgrade game as that if there is 2 players are playing game at same time then google verification must be require. With this update many players can get their id back. So pls take Quick Action for this problem. #Thank you.,"2,2,2017",Supercell,5,403,659,0,0.188,0.074,0,0.107

Dont leave them there because ye are getting a income from them gemming up their troops, heroes, etc with weak offense. Come on now Supercell devs, ye are slacking over there, fix that cc glitch too it's annoying.","1,20,2017",Supercell,3,390,646,3,-0.9217,0.223,0,0.04
